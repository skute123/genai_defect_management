Hi Sudhanshu,


Based on the logs, we can say that the issue is in SearchCustomer\LegacySearch services.
SearchCustomer service always returns zero rows and LegacySearch returns either zero rows or error. Let me share the screenshots:

!2fcd3e91-5d73-4302-92da-b0f75bc64fd9.png!

*and LegacySearch*

*!c8260273-61f1-482c-a909-27284bba8e5c.png!*

 
PFA

Lets sum it up, FrontEnd is not able to retrieve the appropriate OGW Response while searching Customer because of either zero rows or OGW side errors. I assume, that if there is no Customer to retrieve then there is nothing to Check out.

The issue needs to be checked on OGW side: why all Search OGW responses are either empty or have errors.;;;","07/Oct/25 11:50 AM;sudhanshu.shekhar@vodafone.com;[~bharath.krishnamurthy@vodafone.com] .

I believe there might be a slight misunderstanding regarding the issue we reported . This is not related to the customer search functionality.

This is regarding , *no services being triggered, Omnius PCAT and build version is being displayed in the middle-left section of the screen , no vertical scroll bar* visible on the page.

It is specifically occurring during the *order placement* process.

As outlined in the screenshots and test steps I previously shared, we are unable to proceed beyond the *Customer Information* page, where customer details are typically entered.

To ensure better clarity and alignment, I am scheduling a quick call to discuss the issue in more detail.;;;","07/Oct/25 12:49 PM;bharath.krishnamurthy@vodafone.com;[~sudhanshu.shekhar@vodafone.com]
