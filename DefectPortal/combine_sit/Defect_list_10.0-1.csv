 # Add a Mobile package.
 # Add HW , tariff and oneNr. For oderline 1.
 # Add Stone Tariff and optionen (with Onenumber as eSIM) for orderline 2.
 # Add hw (smartwatch) to Stone Tariff.
 # Proceed to checkout...Fill all necessary details
 # Select the SimType as eSIM (for main tariff) and enable eSIM-Push.
 # Select the main tariff, that was booked in the configurator for smartwatch
 # Select The Ultracard SimType as eSIM (with eSIM-Push)
 # Select address as Ship to Store.
 # Validate IBAN...Submit the Order...Verify OGW logs
 # Verify that the Sim (for main tariff and for onenumber ( = Ultracard)) should be picked from OGW_VIRTUAL_SIM table. Note: For activation of STONE a dedicated pool of virtual SIMs will be used. These virtual SIMs are not swappable.
 # Verify that all the subscribers should be activated in KIAS.
 # Verify that sharp SIMSWAP should be triggered right after activation of eSIM main tariff
 # Verify that Email 5910 or Email 5930 should be invoked for Mainsim (depending on eMail-address verification status)
 # Verify that MultiSIMSWAP should be triggered right after activation of eSIM Ultracard.
 # Verify that Email 5910 only should be invoked for ultracard eSIM.
 # Verify that MultiSIM should be booked through ActivateSubscriber at the time of Activation.
 # Verify that order get the Status ""Imported to VORAS""
 # Verify the order get the Status ""VORAS_FINAL_SUCCESS_HANDOUT""(EID + OGWOrderID + OrderlineID) status.
 # Verify that GeteSIMInformation should be triggered for your subscriberNo (main tariff). Note: Based on the response, OGW needs to check the status of the eSIM for tariff option onenumber first. If eSIM-status is ""ready for download without EID"",
 # Verify that MaintainEID should be triggered for your order.
 # Verify that OGW set order-status to ""Completed-Success"" after after EVT_040 is received.

 

Actual Result: Multisimswap is failing for eSIM Ultracard.

Expected Result : Multisimswap should success for eSIM Ultracard.

We are testing the following use case:

 
|*Channel*|Telesales|
|*MainCard SimType*|eSIM|
|*UltraCard SimType*|pSIM|
|*MainCard Activity*|CHANGE PRODUCT|

 

But we are not getting the expected result as *no SIMSWAP request is calling for pSIM Ultracard after getting Omnius SOS* and *Order is getting stucked at Status “InProgress-HWFulfilmentReady”*

 

I also see in the JESI that there is a call to flow {*}vfde_email_activation_flow_V12.xml{*}, but I believe {*}It should not be called there because there is pSIM ultracard instead of eSIM{*}.

!image-2025-08-22-15-28-52-722.png|width=1091,height=584!

Steps to Reproduce:
 # Login to Telesales channel…Perform legacy search on the customer…Load the customer.
 # Click on “Paket Ändern” button.
 # Add main Tariff and optionen (with Onenumber (as pSIM = Physical SIM)))
 # Proceed to checkout…Fill all the necessary details.
 # Select The Ultracard SimType as PhysicalSim.
 # Submit the order…Verify OGW logs.
 # Verify that the Sim (for activation the UltraCard) should be picked from OGW_VIRTUAL_SIM table.
 # Verify that all the subscribers (new main tariff and OneNr) should be activated in KIAS.
 # Verify that MultiSIM should be booked through MultiSIMUCardBk at the time of PreActivation.
 # Verify that, InProgress-HWFulfilmentReady status should be received for orderline (Physical SIM for OneNr).
 # {*}Verify that MultiSIMSWAP should be triggered for PhysicalSim{*}.
 # Verify that Completed-Success status should be received for Orderline

 

Expected Result: {*}Order should completed with successful call for Ultracard pSIM Simswap after getting SOS Omnius{*}.

Actual Result: Order is stuck with the status “InProgress-HWFulfilmentReady” , and there is no SIMSWAP call for Ultracard pSIM.

 # Verify that Email 5910 or Email 5930 should be invoked for Mainsim(depending on eMail-address verification status).
 # Verify that MultiSIMSWAP should be triggered right after activation of eSIM Ultracard.
 # Verify that MultiSIM should be book through MultiSIMUCardBk on getting InProgress-HWFulfilmentReady.
 # Verify that Email 5910 should be invoked only for ultracard eSIM.
 # Verify that, InProgress-HWFulfilmentReady status should be received for orderline(SAP (Z42) has sent EVT_40 to OMNIUS and OMNIUS sent this status to OGW).
 # Verify that GeteSIMInformation should be triggered for mainsim.
 # Verify MaintainEID should be triggered.
 # Verify that the Completed-Success status should be received from KIAS-EAI -> OGW for the Orderline.

Steps to reproduce:
 # Login to Telesales channel.
 # Add a mobile package.
 # Select Tariff , HW(with esim) and optionen(OneNr.)
 # Proceed to checkout.
 # Fill all the necessary details.
 # Select Simtype as Esim and enable Esim push.
 # Select OneNumber Simtype as Esim.
 # Validate IBAN.
 # Submit the order.
 # Verify Sim should be picked from OGW_VIRTUAL_TABLE.
 # Verify Sub should be activated in KIAS.
 # Check the Esim_status for both the serial numbers in esim_profile table, it should be P(Pending).
 # Run the UD file, status should be changed to R(ready).
 # Trigger the Completed-success request via SOAP for your orderline.
 # Then we got the status ""OnHold-PendingDocCreation"".

These are the new logs  [^462111_WS.xml];;;","18/Jul/25 11:01 AM;shruti.kanchan@vodafone.com;Hi All,
 
As discussed during the call with Jan, Andrey, Anurag, Abhishek, and Pallavi, I’d like to reiterate the following clarification:
 
Jan confirmed that for ILS scenarios - where there is no change in hardware and the ILS changes pertain only to tariff, options, and discounts, there is no separate requirement to generate a DF contract document.
 
Omnius indicates Device Financing related submit parameters only when there is a selection of a DFP Device SKU.
 
The mobile contract generation will continue to follow the business-as-usual process. Therefore, the SubmitOrder from OIL to OGW will not include the MobileContractDocumentforDF parameters, as there is no hardware or shipping amount that needs to be excluded.
 
@Pallavi The previous PriceInfo tag seen in ILS scenario was invalid (separate defect which is now closed), I believe this fix was already delivered. 
 
Thank you,
Shruti

Hello Abhishek,


Handing of GASO response since wave4.1 and later on there is no change is done from any stream.

We done an internal investigation and found that GASO response attached to this ticket is manually created stub response data and these data is not correct (like no entry for {{StandardDeliveryIndicator}} = true & {{DeliveryTimeDetails}} has missing child attribute like{{{}ShippingNetFee{}}}), therefore UI doesn’t have appropriate outcome.

So it required correct GASO response data maybe from production ENV using same ident and orderline.

Could you please check this with OGW team on further updates.;;;","14/Jul/25 5:25 PM;bharath.krishnamurthy@vodafone.com;[~abhishek.dwivedi@vodafone.com] [~pallavi.chaudhari1@vodafone.com]

Hi Sudhanshu,

It looks like *GigaKombi Eligibility* service is not configured at the SIT-3 BO.

Can you please check Back Office settings once and configured that settings and retry the scenario.

Hi Sudhanshu ,

I see on SIT 3 we have currently old build of 10.0.0-B243, so I would suggest  to update SIT3 s/w version to omnius-ose-10.0.0-B259 PROD go-live version and also PCAT supporting the omnius-ose-10.0.0-B259 OSE version and retest the scenario once.;;;","24/Jun/25 1:38 PM;sudhanshu.shekhar@vodafone.com;We tried triggering an order on SIT3 again and observed that we are not facing this issue anymore.

Hi Sudhanshu,

Based on further analysis of logs it is identified that the exception is from KIAS backend for SubmitOrder service triggered for Contract Summary from OSE. From the exception message it seems we are missing Dealer code info on Contract Summary request from OSE. Dealer Code details are connected with sales id of the agent and the store we select. So, looks something wrong with dealer mapping due to which agent not set proper sales ids further leading to the above exception.

Kindly verify the dealer store & sales id mapping is correct for the agent we are trying to create the order.

Hi Bharath,

 

We have same OIL packages deployed to both SIT-2 and SIT-3. SIT-2 has no such issues. 

 

The same time OGW has different versions of services.

SIT-3 OGW uses the old version of service. That service does not have DocumentList nodes

 

!image-2025-07-03-16-31-08-385.png!

 

On the other hand SIT-2 OGW service has it

 

!image-2025-07-03-16-32-51-928.png!

Thus, OGW has to doublecheck services versions on their side

 

Could you please check with OGW team on this for further analysis.;;;","23/Jul/25 2:41 PM;gaurav.chauhan4@vodafone.com;After the latest deployment on SIT 3.

When we are triggering new mobile ACQ Telesales in SIT-5 we are blocked on Delivery option when we select Carrier Ident.

We noticed that Standard Liefertermin option is missing when we select Carrier Ident. Hence the weiter button is disabled.

Hi Charalambos ,

I`ve made some Archive log analysis. Let me share the observations.
I believe that the Standard Liefertermin option depends upon StandardDeliveryIndicator field value in GetAvailableShippingOptions response.
I analyzed these two cases, Archive logs (I chose Archive based on screenshot time).
For DHL, we have several AvailableShippingOptionsDetails sections, one of which consists of

*<StandardDeliveryIndicator>true</StandardDeliveryIndicator>*

For blocking case we have only one AvailableShippingOptionsDetails section with

*<StandardDeliveryIndicator>false</StandardDeliveryIndicator>*

Could you please  ask OGW team to make the appropriate changes (set this Indicator as true for failed case) to check on SIT.;;;","19/May/25 1:49 PM;harsh.gupta@vodafone.com;Could I get the User Story related to setting StandardDeliveryIndicator field in the  GetAvailableShippingOptions response as the last change in mapper was in 2022
Thanks;;;","26/May/25 6:07 PM;bharath.krishnamurthy@vodafone.com;[~harsh.gupta@vodafone.com] [~charalambos.stylianou@vodafone.com]

Hi Harsh/Charalambos,
 
OIL passes on what it receives from OGW unconditionally. OSE disables the button based on the response. Initially, OGW sends this value as false.
I found several related stories



I`m not sure what is the latest logic. It is better to check with BA from your side and any new requirements has come on this, please share the user story details for reference;;;","27/May/25 6:57 AM;bharath.krishnamurthy@vodafone.com;[~harsh.gupta@vodafone.com] [~charalambos.stylianou@vodafone.com]

We tried testing a D2C scenario in the retail channel.

Steps to reproduce:
 # Login to Retail channel.
 # Search and load a debit customer.
 # Perform D2C.
 # Fill all the necessary details.
 # Select Ship to store option.
 # Validate IBAN.
 # Generate Documents.
 # Submit the order.
 # Check the subscriber should activated in KIAS.
 # After getting OnHold-Pending-POS-HWFulfillment, trigger VORAS_FINAL_SUCCESS_SHIP_TO_STORE_HANDOUT using SOAPUI(because we didn’t have VORAS connectivity).

 

Expected Result: Order should completed successfully.

Actual Result:  *There is missing some information in the PushOrderStatus request after getting VORAS_FINAL_SUCCESS_SHIP_TO_STORE_HANDOUT status from VORAS.*

 ** 

If we trigger HW-fulfillment-ready status using SOAPUI after that PushorderStatus, The LoanActivation service is triggered twice which results in the following error:

according to US:

OS-59191

IF /CDM/Order/TargetOrder/Product/Product/Product/Attributes/Attributen[Code=FutureActivationDate]not available 

Then perform below steps : 
 * OGW will update the new fields if received from VORAS as described under https://jira.sp.vodafone.com/browse/OS-59227 
 * OGW will create DF BAN if does not exist already as described under https://jira.sp.vodafone.com/browse/OS-58094
 * OGW will invoke the loan activation process as described under   https://jira.sp.vodafone.com/browse/OS-57417 for the loan application id which is already approved by loan application process.

'None' is not valid for telesales.

You can find the related Jira ticket here: OS-54821.

We can perform a VVL check for customers with foreign addresses. However, we encounter errors when attempting to proceed with VVL (Standard prolongation).

Initially, we receive a 500 Internal Server Error. Upon retrying, we get the following error message:

 

*Error:* “This product has already been changed in your shopping cart. Please empty your shopping cart first.”

 

Notably, there are no products in the shopping cart.

 

Could you please investigate this issue? Attached are the test results for your reference.

{*}Test Data{*}: 20112151

*Steps to Reproduce:*
 # Log in to the Telesales/Retail channel.
 # Search for and load a VVL-eligible customer with a foreign address.
 # Perform the VVL check.
 # After the VVL check passes, try to Standard prolongation.
 #  

*Expected Result:* The agent should be able to access the configurator page to perform VVL. 

*Actual Result:* Omnius throws an error after clicking the contract extension button.

Hi Riya,

I checked further and as per DF EPIC changes there is no issue here. According to DF changes we only filter the hardware products to be shown based on Tariff selection and DF indicator, price of the Hardware which are compatible. Issue here is generic where tariff monthly price not showing which can be due to missing values on mobile PCAT.

Hi Anurag,

 

Not sure about your query?

You need to modify the last name from the response of {_}VFDESubscriberD2CEligibilityOutputDataType{_}? 

Because that is where Omnius receives the First Name, Last Name (s), DOB details from. 

This is sent by OGW and OGW gets this from KIAS;;;","18/Apr/25 2:34 PM;bharath.krishnamurthy@vodafone.com;[~anurag.vaid@vodafone.com]

Hi Anurag,
 
 
MTAN authentication is a partial step here to only authenticate the Debit Subscriber.

The First Name, Last Name(s), Date of Birth details are received as a response on Omnius from _VFDESubscriberD2CEligibilityOutputDataType_ which is sent by OGW and OGW gets it from EAIService.

Hi Sudhanshu,

Based on further analysis I can see from DB that the rule expression is not matching the criteria to show DF tariff. Kindly check below Screenshots and also US reference mentioned below.

So from OSE point there is nothing wrong and is working as expected.

 

Could you please check with PCAT team once and update.

 

 

Thank you

as per comment on 25-04-25 from you (see below) you asked to add ""DEU"" for correct handling.
This is what Kevin did and what was perfectly fine last week for SIT test.
But now it seemed to be the case that this PCAT setting is no longer valid.
In attached screenshot you can see setting within PCAT is 100% correct.
Please initiate investigation by TechM - seemed to be something have been changed this week.

HiSudhanshu ,

I checked further on SIT1 and it looks like customer specific issue. For customer *20130750* it is working as expected and for the new customer created by Amdocs *KS_20112151* its failing during prolongation (not allowed to continue).

Which means it still working as expected after the rule expression change by PCAT team and we expect it be separate issue where customer prolongation is failing for specific customer saying “{*}Request '/configurator/index/inlife' failed with status code: 500 Internal Server Error{*}“

Hi Sudhanshu,

Below is the difference on customer level

Customer mentioned ticket for which its working *KS_20130750*

*!08a8b665-7fe7-4fde-b118-1ea89d260ee2.png!*

This looks clear data issue which needs to be fixed while creating customer.

 

Thanks

Hi Tanvi,

Can you please provide customer test data for this D2C scenario along with Mode123 OGW response logs

 

If test Data at least you can provide, we can fetch the logs, but sometimes Serviceability issue, or getting error while retrieving customer info details then fetching logs also will be getting delayed, this is our concerns not all the times sometimes due to environment issues or backend system connectivity issues.

 

Whenever you have performed the flow for any ILS related scenarios, please provide customer test data and Mode123 OGW response logs that time only would be better.

 

 

Thank you

Hi Tanvi,

Can you Please specify if this loading is an existing Debit customer for which MIGCOC (Debit to Credit) is being executed or if the D2C Owner Change is attempted in checkout for an ACQ flow.
For MIGCOC flow - Porting is not allowed by Process

For D2C owner Change - Porting Checkbox will be disabled again this is an existing process

Tanvi - In the debit to credit scenario, the customer is an existing Vodafone user migrating from prepaid to postpaid. Since this is an internal migration, porting is not typically expected or applicable here.
This process has been in place for a long time, and offering porting (switching from another operator to vodafone) in such cases is not aligned with standard process on OSF. If there’s any confusion around this, I’d suggest referring to the existing process documentation.;;;","14/Apr/25 12:54 PM;sudhanshu.shekhar@vodafone.com;There might be some confusion because of Business User Story: https://jira.sp.vodafone.com/browse/OS-64366. because as per this US, porting is applicable for D2C scenarios as well.

A call has been scheduled with Rob to clarify this.

Hi Sudhanshu,
 
 
In the order overview the “cancel” button will be enabled, if the order is in status pending and at least one included package is in status “OnHold–PendingOnlineIdentification” or “OnHold-PendingOnlineIdentSignDoc”. Clicking on the button will call a synchronic OGW service CancelOrderLines, for cancelling all mobile postpaid packages pending for online ident in OGW. In case the order is not in the correct status anymore the service will send an error message stating the reason for not executing the cancel request. If the current status of the order still allowing the cancellation, then the status of all pending mobile postpaid packages will be set to “Completed-CustomerCancelled”, the onlineIdent process will be cancelled and the pending orchestration workflow will be terminated. Statuses updates will be communicated to Omnius with standard functionality.;;;","11/Apr/25 12:45 PM;sudhanshu.shekhar@vodafone.com;Hi [~bharath.krishnamurthy@vodafone.com]  [~shruti.kanchan@vodafone.com] 
This order is waiting for online identification still we can't see an option to cancel this package.

Hello Rob,

 

We are trying to test the scenario where agent tries to cancel the pre-order package from Omnius, as a result OSF (OGW) should  automatically  cancel this DF Loan application.

But we couldn’t find an option to cancel the pre-order package from Omnius.

We tried discussing this with omnius team but couldn’t find a resolution.

Someone suspected that Omnius had previously disabled this functionality while we were talking about it with the Omnius team. 
However, we were unable to find any supporting documents or evidence. 

Would you kindly let us know if you have any ideas or how we should move forward?

Hi [~sudhanshu.shekhar@vodafone.com] 

For the above problematic order we saw that the package status was _*InProgress-Failed-OpenExternalTicket*_ which is not expected to show the cancel package button. In order to test cancel package button functionality we modified the status to _*OnHold-PendingOnlineIdentification*_ and then we can see the button as seen below and followed the process to by clicking on cancel package and we see the service is also getting called.

Hello All,

 

Thanks for joining.

 

*Please find below MOM:*

 
 * We discussed business user story: [https://jira.sp.vodafone.com/browse/OS-55738|https://ind01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fjira.sp.vodafone.com%2Fbrowse%2FOS-55738&data=05%7C02%7CBK00526624%40techmahindra.com%7C32f2eab8ba4e4864b04008dd80da0170%7Cedf442f5b9944c86a131b42b03a16c95%7C0%7C0%7C638808396107747145%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJFbXB0eU1hcGkiOnRydWUsIlYiOiIwLjAuMDAwMCIsIlAiOiJXaW4zMiIsIkFOIjoiTWFpbCIsIldUIjoyfQ%3D%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&sdata=tUqh3BFcurVBmlHCyv0tnKfHqPklHCtyiJS2%2BhHb7Kc%3D&reserved=0]

BUSINESS-WP1: As a sales agent I want be able to Cancel the Pre-Order package from Omnius and as a result, to cancel the DF Loan application process.

 
 * {*}Telesales{*}: Only after successful online identification does OGW start the LoanApplication process.

And we don’t have possibility to cancel an Omnius pre-order package after the online Identification has passed.

We discussed it with [@Robert|mailto:Robert.Goebbels@Vodafone.com] [@Shruti|mailto:Shruti.Kanchan@TechMahindra.com] and omnius colleagues, however once LoanApplication is initiated, there is no method to cancel a pre-order package from Omnius.

 
 * *Retail:* We don’t have this possibility of cancelling a pre-order package from Omnius in Retail channel.

This story is cancelled after all:
REASON:
IS SITUATION (assuming the PCAT would be configured, so that Hardware is defined as Pre-Order hardware) only if the PRE-ORDER is still in the status : ""pending online-ident""  this pre-order can be cancelled. We do not know if this is a bug or a feature, but:
 # it is not as we (designteam3) had expected/  had understood the is situation
 # assuming that  it is a defect/designGap:  then this is NO DeviceFinancing issue, but a production defect.

This means however, that this use-case as described here, is obsolete (for now)
 # first of all:  with the current PCAT configuration in production, the pre-sales use- will not happen
 # second:  even if at some point in time VF decides to re-activate the pre-order functionality in OSF, even then this use-case will not take place until this functionality is changed (change-request)

-> it makes no sense to invest time in integration / acc test for this businss story 
->  business stroy has been cancelled

Hi Ahmed Ibrahim,

 

Now after we moved to new cable plugin we no longer execute rules within OSE, we just send the request via cable phar file in OSE which acts as rest client and further processing will be done on cable backend.

So kindly share the logs to Cable backend team to validate the exception. Or may be assign it to VF team to check the same with cable team on our behalf as this is not an OSE issue

Thanks

Exact root cause of this issue was not known

But nothing can be changed or fixed from omnius(OSE/OIL) side

We are submitting a new Retail ACQ flow in the SIT 1 environment, which includes a cancel status of *Completed-HWFulfillmentFailed.* After this, the Loan cancellation API should be called, as outlined in the user story:

[https://jira.sp.vodafone.com/browse/OS-59193]

But we are not getting Loan cancellation API call.

 

*Steps to reproduce:*
 # Login to retail channel.
 # Select Mobile package, then DF tariff and HW.
 # Fill details.
 # submit order.
 # In OGW logs we get latest ""OnHold-PendingHWFulfillment"" Status after triggering through SOAP.
 # Verify DeviceLoanOrderID is available in OGW logs
 # Verify OGW should prepare the input towards GFP with loan id and invoke a loan cancellation API call to cancel an existing loan application.

*Expected Results:* OGW should prepare the input towards GFP with loan id and invoke a loan cancellation API call to cancel an existing loan application.

*Actual Result:* The Loan cancellation API call is failing.

Hello, OGW Team,

 

We are in the process of executing a new mobile acquisition order through the retail channel. After submitting the order, we aim to receive the status ""{*}Completed-HWFulfillmentFailed.""{*}

Here are the steps we are following:

 
 # Log in to the retail channel.
 # Select the first mobile package.
 # Choose the DF tariff and hardware (HW).
 # Proceed to checkout.
 # Fill in all required customer details.
 # Submit the order.
 # Fetch the OGW logs.

can you please share here the sos request from Omnius?
also the ogw order id.
from the DB, i found this OGWOrder id: 8976135
is that your order?
if yes, ou are sending the wrong set order status from Omnius.
according to drools, when sending Completed-HWFulfillmentFailed you also need to send these values as well:
system == ""Omnius"" , event == ""Completed-HWFulfillmentFailed"" , {color:#FF0000}errorCode == ""EVT_150""{color}
error code is missing in your set order status request;;;","03/Apr/25 1:03 PM;anurag.vaid@vodafone.com;Hi [~ran.farjun1@vodafone.com]

there are 2 missing fields:

{
                    ""name"": ""locationType"",
                    ""value"": """"
                }

 

And

""contactType"": """"

contact type is OGW issue, and we have a fix for it.
locationType is missing from the submit request so its empty.
Gaurab will ask Rob and Andrey today regarding  how to map deliveryLocation in this case.

we are not responsible for Hardware, these are coming from SAP.

Hardware Data are just integrated in the Mobile PCAT Files.

So somebody which is able to modify the Hardware data has to fix it and we have to deliver again a new PCAT for it.;;;","01/Apr/25 1:53 PM;abhishek.dwivedi@vodafone.com;even after the new PCAT deployment, which is happened today, we still cannot see DF hardware with pre-order status.

Hi Chahat,

 

while adding kip package, we noticed by rule kable tv is also added. this rule causing issue in the new connection section. hence this is the pcat issue. For testing please remove the kable tv package from the shopping cart. Then you can able to proceed.

We tried running one Retail New ACQ order with DF tariff and HW in SIT1 but it got failed with status *Completed-RejectedByGFP.*

However omnius is not updating the correct status in order manager page.

 

As per Business US https://jira.sp.vodafone.com/browse/OS-58114 and omnius US: https://jira.sp.vodafone.com/browse/OS-60867.
 * Omnius Ordermanager must reflect the orderline status to '{*}Fehlgeslagen'{*}
 * Omnius Ordermanager must reflect a new message “ *Geräte-Ratenzahlung abgelehnt* “ in the {*}BestellInformation section{*}.

 

Could you please check?

 

PFA PushOrderStatus logs for your reference.

 

*Steps to reproduce:*
 # Login to Retail channel
 # Add a mobile package
 # Select DF tariff and HW
 # Move to checkout
 # Fill all the request details
 # Submit the order
 # Order should fail with status Completed-RejectedByGFP.

For *UNTRUSTED* customers, use *_ZINIA_AP_*

By the way this morning I tested and it’s working with both the surnames, so it seems to be an intermittent issue on Santander side that should be resolved;;;","19/Mar/25 4:18 PM;horst.froehlich@vodafone.com;You +must use+ as surname

*ZINIA_TRUSTED_AP*

*ZINIA_AP*

Only this values will have consistent behaviour for the test.

Hi Sudhanshu/Pallavi,

As per the user story ticket OS-59153

https://jira.sp.vodafone.com/browse/OS-59153

Value should be passed as *Yes/No*

OIL had to pass *Y\N* value to OGW. Therefore, it works as expected from OIL point of view. OGW team  expected to have as it is {*}Yes\No{*}. So now will do the changes to *Y/N* and update here by today EOD.;;;","10/Mar/25 11:56 AM;bharath.krishnamurthy@vodafone.com;[~sudhanshu.shekhar@vodafone.com]

As per the test findings there the process is successful until contract summary process

The submit is successful in GenerateContract Mode and we could see porting information being sent until GenerateContract Mode’s submit order however for fulfilment mode submit to be successful the GetDocument call must send us a success response which will enable downloading contract PDF document in turn enable the signosign for contract only post that fulfilment mode submit will be possible.

Please let us know what is expected from Omnius side on this ticket. OrderLineStatus is determined from PushOrderStatus. This should be evaluated from OGW. If something is expected from Omnius please clarify and also share the PushOrderStatus for this order.;;;","27/Feb/25 2:11 PM;sudhanshu.shekhar@vodafone.com;Hi [~shruti.kanchan@vodafone.com] ,

I had updated the details over email, updating here as well.

Actually we are getting Ident method as none in submit order xml that's why OGW is not triggering this status.

PFA submit order logs as well.

Hi Sudhanshu,

As far as I can see, you compared different files: one is for Fulfillment mode and the other one is for GenerateContract.
If we take a look at the GenerateContract mode files for both OSE and OGW, we can see that this IdentMethod has been passed accordingly.

OSE - OIL

!image-2025-03-04-10-25-35-147.png!

OIL - OGW

!image-2025-03-04-10-26-50-348.png!

PFA

 

The files for Fulfillment mode don`t contain such information for both OSE and OGW

Everything looks fine.

 

Could you please check with OGW team once and update here.

We are unable to proceed with the order submission with *DF tariff and Hardware* in *telesales in SIT 1* env because *the Weiter button is disabled* on the checkout page, as it recognizes the German address as a foreign address.

Steps to reproduce:
 # Login to Telesales channel.
 # Search and load a debit customer.
 # Select Debit to Credit Option.
 # Then add {*}DF tariff and Hardware{*}.
 # Then proceed to checkout.
 # Fill the required details and click on *Weiter* button.

Hi Sudhanshu ,

I have discussed with @Shruti Kanchan and there is no such information shared by VF about DF endpoints for SIT. This needs to be checked with VF and configured This is POC from VF about the end points [Sebastian.Schier@Vodafone.com|mailto:Sebastian.Schier@Vodafone.com]

Omnius uses URL like [https://dxl-preprod.rat-hub.citt.connect-vf.de|https://dxl-preprod.rat-hub.citt.connect-vf.de/] & [https://dxl.preprod.api.vodafone.de|https://dxl.preprod.api.vodafone.de/] we can try using these URLs but I believe there is also a to-do for VF DXL infra team to allow these URLs (Manages the DXL services)

 

Could you please check with Sebastian and DXL infra team on this for further details.;;;","21/Jan/25 3:58 PM;ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com;I understood from Horst and BJörn that all settings are in place, can you confirm?;;;","22/Jan/25 12:06 PM;bharath.krishnamurthy@vodafone.com;[~sudhanshu.shekhar@vodafone.com]
