Seems in sit1 we have inconsistency in the DB.
when I connect to user:  ogw1_c, and I run this query:
SELECT sim_number FROM ogw_virtual_sim WHERE status = 'A' AND sim_swap_done = 'N' AND (V_SIM_CATEGORY = '074' OR V_SIM_CATEGORY is null) ORDER BY update_timestamp ASC FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED;

Im getting valid results.

 

But, if I run the same query on user: ogw1, and run the same query, im getting 0 result.

This is why we are getting the error: No avilable resources found in OGW_VIRTUAL_SIM Table.

Hi Pallavi,

In the submit order from OSE to OGW ,details are submitted

!6c9eb494-4425-4745-8029-46093acb9942.png!

Even in the attached logs by you, we see the details being sent.more over getOrderResponse is not OSF part

!c36e025b-2e20-4022-a43b-40ca6061ca8d.png!

Could you please check with OGW team once on this and update here
 ;;;","13/Aug/25 3:46 PM;harsh.gupta@vodafone.com;HI [~bharath.krishnamurthy@vodafone.com]
According to the current OGW Logic

There should be a *<ComponentType>TariffOption</ComponentType>* in the Submit Order Request
To output the fields TariffOption and TariffOptionDesc

Thanks,
Harsh;;;","14/Aug/25 9:18 AM;bharath.krishnamurthy@vodafone.com;[~pallavi.chaudhari1@vodafone.com] [~harsh.gupta@vodafone.com]

Hi Palalvi/Harsh,

The componentType comes from multimapper and we see that the provided multimapper has this field missing. hence it is not populated in submitorder.

Mobile_Multimapper_Kias.csv

!bd5cc399-2e8e-44ee-878c-32733fc16752.png!

 

You can cross verify the same in BO ,componentType is empty 

!9b7e40fe-fa75-442a-b3c2-584e4f0a801b.png!

 

If we manually add from BO

!677a2be3-33a4-4e02-bad0-b2bd135e4ebf.png!

 

then you see the componentType

 

!57e2d95f-fdee-41f1-97b5-d6d8479c7f7f.png!

So Its a PCAT multimapper file issue .;;;","21/Aug/25 1:32 PM;sudhanshu.shekhar@vodafone.com;Reply from Thomas:

I could identify the issue in PCAT. I will copy a new 10.1 PCAT to our sandbox PCAT-ACC3 first. From there it could then be copied tomorrow during the course of the day after a short test.;;;","25/Aug/25 8:40 AM;sudhanshu.shekhar@vodafone.com;looking at BO configuration after new PCAT deployment, seems like this issue is fixed.

But we will retest it once we have OGW pointing to Old-OGW as we have some issue with New OGW.

*!image-2025-08-25-12-10-30-820.png!*;;;","25/Aug/25 11:45 AM;sudhanshu.shekhar@vodafone.com;It is working fine now.

Hi Chahat,

Products are not visible. do we have FusionC PCAT imported in this SIT1 Env?

 without PCAT, products can't be visible

Hi Chahat,
 
 
Verified with help of Akhilesh. Solstice pcat is missing in SIT1 and hence solstice products are not visible.

Hi Horst,

The Tech M team confirmed that there is no PCAT available on SIT1 related to FuC due to which FuC products are not visible.

Hi Horst,

unfortunately there seems to be an issue on PCAT-INT (and also on other env.), that prevents me from publishing a new PCAT/baseline. I addressed it already to Akhilesh for checking on priority.

I will publish once the env. is working again.

Hi Riya/Gaurav,,


I believe, we are talking about MobileContractDocumentfor field that was recently described in 
[https://bmcomviva.atlassian.net/issues/?selectedIssue=VFDED2W100S-610] .

This US was implemented in the OIL package {*}25.07.03.10005{*}.

The *SIT-5* environment has an older version of OIL {*}25.05.23.10005{*}. Moreover, I don`t see the implemented field in the original ProcessOrder Request. I suspect that OSE version installed on SIT-5 is also rather old and does not include these changes.

May I ask you to
 # Please, double-check the OSE version installed on SIT-5. Does it include these changes?

 # We need to deploy a newer version of OIL package.;;;","31/Jul/25 8:58 AM;gaurav.chauhan4@vodafone.com;[~bharath.krishnamurthy@vodafone.com] 

we had requested deployment of the latest Wave 10.0.1 OSE and OIL builds on SIT. However, the currently deployed versions are:

 
 * *OSE:* 10.0.1-B47
 * *OIL:* 25.05.23.10005

 

[@Sandeep|mailto:sp00123672@techmahindra.com] – Could you please check how these builds are already outdated within just two days?

 

We need the *latest OSE and OIL builds* deployed on *SIT5 ASAP* to proceed with our execution.;;;","31/Jul/25 9:29 AM;bharath.krishnamurthy@vodafone.com;[~riya.tomar@vodafone.com] [~gaurav.chauhan4@vodafone.com]

Hi Riya,Abhishek,

I checked the SIT-5 logs and the latest change regarding this MobileContractDocumentforDF. May we ask OGW to clarify what field do they expect to see under OrderLine node?

Y/N are correct values in MMC. According KIAS Spec in MMO the value ‘N’ was never valid values (since 2016), see attached values.

Y / N

the EAI ActivationInterface (CSM495) should not have any enumerations in the XSD in EAI. So you should be able to pass any value as along as it is char(1). KIAS validates the content, EAI should only validate the formal correctness (data type and length).

As CR is raised this defect will be retested as part of CR

*OS-76120-* BUSINESS As a system I want to call the eligibility service with the correct response mapping so that the response is consumed correctly(CR949)

hence closing  the defect status here.

Hi [~sudhanshu.shekhar@vodafone.com]
 
his is not hardcoded to CYI or COH , The value of this field is derived based on the SIMOnlyFlag in the PCAT.
I checked the SIMonlytag is set to false hence the CustomerOrderType is sent as CY1 which means prepaid with hardware and that is not the case here.
 
This needs to be modified by PCAT to set the SIMonly flag. Attaching Vikas's confirmation too

I have attached the required submit order request logs. Please check and Update.;;;","15/Jul/25 4:47 PM;thomas.jerke@vodafone.com;Attribute DiscountExpiryDate is not known by PCAT team and I not aware of any PCAT user story for this topic.

Limited discounts in PCAT have a sliding calculator value in month which is used to calculate the sliding calcurlator steps.

It might be a wrong testcase. In the logfile I found only discount SKU ""KCIOT2FRABv4_2017"" which is NOT time limited.

Hi [~riya.tomar@vodafone.com]  in the PCAT file it is part of Mobile_Categories.CSV

I can see that this SKU is not part of the category *Mobile→Discount_No_CS_Confirmation in the files I have, however on SIT also this needs to be verified on PCAT files.*

this is a Design-GAP because PCAT team have never been involved in Design for those CRs.

As discussed for Soho consumer customer ( either SOHO private or SOHO RVPrivate)
We always send CompanyContactInfo node . 
this can be ref from other Contact node (where ContactRole=LC/DC/BC) contains CompanyContactInfo node as well.

So this is not an issue in Omnius. fix required in OGW system

Hi Chahat,

 

Additional information received from [@Chahat Khokhar|mailto:Chahat.Khokhar@amdocs.com] over Teams indicates that the {*}order status is ""CS Created""{*}. A screenshot of the offer_status_visibility_editability database table was also shared, which governs visibility in both *Offer Manager* and {*}Customer 360{*}.

Based on this information, we can conclude the following:
 # {*}Orders will not be visible in Offer Manager{*}, as the visible_in_offer_manager column is set to 0 for the ""CS Created"" status.

 # {*}Orders should be visible in Customer 360{*}, since the visible_in_360 column is set to 1 for the same status. However, the order is currently not appearing in Customer 360.

Therefore, the second point needs to be investigated further to understand why the order is not visible in Customer 360 despite the visibility flag being correctly set.

Hi Chahat,

 

Regarding OS-74385 ticket

This CR896 is not for Techm(Omnius) , this is Amdocs CR.

 

Where in e2e flow test team wanted to test a particular usecase for salesflow having agent with role (business function)  B2B_TELESALES_OL_AGENT_NOCS

 

where it found this role doesn't exist in Omnius s/w.

 

*Conclusion: delivery of Role data is not part of Omnius software delivery*

 

Hint : creation of role in Omnius can be done via 2 ways.
 #  Omnius gets the Role data via nGUM (multiple end points) - must be check with VF user management
 # maunally manupulation of data via backoffice
 #  

So, this is not an issue, its an configuration topic.;;;","30/Jun/25 1:56 PM;anurag.vaid@vodafone.com;Hi All

Hi Abhishek,

Hi Anurag,

As far as I understand, for other Ident options not only Online Ident.

That is because of OGW returns us this method only in the Response. 

This needs to be checked from OGW side by triggering this service GetIdentMethods? For that particular case we get

 

<DATA xmlns="""">
<IdentMethodsList>
<IdentMethodsDetails>
<IdentMethod>Online</IdentMethod>
</IdentMethodsDetails>
</IdentMethodsList>
</DATA>;;;","26/Jun/25 9:25 AM;anurag.vaid@vodafone.com;Hi [~bharath.krishnamurthy@vodafone.com] 

I think after the latest update from the OGW team, we are now able to see the other ident methods.

Hi Abhishek,

Trying to perform ILS flow, Even customer search is not working for *cable Stack*

Customer Test data: 935191417, KD_935191417

 

Regarding CR841 test case execution is blocked .

 

 ;;;","07/Jul/25 4:07 PM;ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com;This ticket is from 13th of June, who can speed up the resolution?;;;","08/Jul/25 1:39 PM;abhishek.dwivedi@vodafone.com;We are still checking with Cable PCAT team;;;","14/Jul/25 4:02 PM;philipp.moers@vodafone.com;Hi all, 

this is blocking our SIT. Last update was provided 6 days ago. 
Any update here? What is the current status? ;;;","15/Jul/25 4:04 PM;philipp.moers@vodafone.com;Hi [~sudhanshu.shekhar@vodafone.com] ,

any update here? ;;;","22/Jul/25 2:19 PM;gaurav.chauhan4@vodafone.com;Details from today's Meeting:-

 

Connect the NDS Import Tool to PTVFP and/or P2VFP (as all the other environments.
 * SIT don’t have access to the NDS import tool.
@Peter: do you have access to this tool and could either provide access to the DXC Infra-Team or do you can do it yourself for us? 😊

Use a different address which works
 * SIT tried 5 different addresses – all with same error. 
Does anybody has further addresses to test?

Use a dump of ASBADM of a database with a proper address.
 * Experience from the past: effort around 12 PDs and issues with integrations after it.
If this option will be used we need to prepare for a 12 days downtime for P2/PT environment.

Specify the expected properties of your address and raise an order to the vendor of VFP to extend the testing data OC
 * This should be the *cleanest and best option* according to Mona. 
To follow this option we do need to:
1) Figure out how to order the OC (What does OC stands for?). Who does know how to?

Install OC on P2/PT on VFP application.
 # Compare working and not working databases on SQL level and patch the not working database until you get the expected results

 * This can only be done by Peter!? Mona does only access to P2/PT which is not working.

Hi all,

After some investigation, the request reached BLES, but we found this message in the logs: `message"":""JsonMapper_Exception: JSON property \""website\"" does not exist in object of type Vodafone\\Bles\\Domain\\RulesInput
RulesInput` so I believe that might be because of the version of BLES not being compatible with PCAT(the BLES version in logs is {""bles-version"":[""0.525.0""] but the suitable bles version for this PCAT is 0.503.0). Therefore, after updating the PCAT version, it should work.
Regards;;;","09/Jun/25 1:35 PM;anurag.vaid@vodafone.com;Hi [~bharath.krishnamurthy@vodafone.com] 

We are now able to see the cable products.

Hi Chahat,
 
The issue persists on SIT-1. However, the same Request passed successfully for SIT-2 env. The error comes from OGW itself.
Thus, this issue should be verified on the OGW side.

Could you please check with OGW team.;;;","22/May/25 1:47 PM;chahat.khokhar@vodafone.com;Hi Irina,
