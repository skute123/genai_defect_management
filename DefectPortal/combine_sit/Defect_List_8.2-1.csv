Date : 31/Jan/2024

As per internal investigation done in Omnius solution and identified as below.

According to wave4 PDT epic (ref Epic screen below) 

conclusion : Omnius trigger GASO service per package and later based on per package response,  shipping fee would be shown over UI 
either standard service delievry  or via service delivery option.(i..e UPS/GLS`/UPS)

After selection of service delivery,  Omnius add static sku in Shopping cart with shipping fee value.
(i..e shippingfee) where this shipping fee send to backend via processorder/submitOrder request xml.

 

 

*Note: In case of multiple mobile package having multiple shippe fee, then Omnius must set shipping fee for package which has highest shipping fee value  and rest package shipping fee must be considerd as 0.00.(no charge) :*

 

Issue identified

 # In case of multiple Mobile : this seems not wokring correctly. even highest shipping fee price for shippigfee sku not show w over UI (order summary and order overview page), currently show 0.0 for all mobile packages.

Hi Sudhanshu,

 

Is it possible to share activity log that you performed on SIT-1. As we can see it is  frequently down on past 4-5 days.

 

Almost same build was there in ACC where no issue with GUI atleast.

 

Team is waiting for their Citrix issue to resolve so by that they can go through the log and figure out the abnormal things if any. Upon Citrix access resolved they will check and revert back (Citrix access failure for all infra resource at the moment)

Hi Pallavi

 

Please be more specific as you are saying order is failing, but where it is failing?

Are you getting some error message while submitting or is it failed in backend?

I am trying to place an order on sit1 but validate address is failing so I could not try to reproduce.

 

Could you please attached the Test result document or error screenshot for this issue.

Hi Sunil ,

 

From frontend we are getting status as *ordercompletedwithfailure* . Please find below screenshorts .

 

!OS-49451.png!

 

And order is failing in backend with below message  

    <WorkItemDescription>Error: Could not create Process Order Request</WorkItemDescription>

 

Please note :- As order is failing so fulfillment is also not triggered for this .

 

validate address is failing because regular cable downtime is ongoing plz try to reproduce in sometime (after 50 min )

Hi Pallavi,

 

As per the log shared the Generatecontract request is failing on OGW side, so please check with OGW why the order is getting failed as we need to know the issue in the request for the failure.;;;","11/Dec/23 11:51 AM;pallavi.chaudhari1@vodafone.com;Received an update from Omnius team as below

Based on further analysis order processing is failing within OSF throwing an exception, exception says issue with billing address.

Billing address captured looks not stored as part of checkout step, so we need to look into checkout behaviour and then submit order.

Further we need to try reproducing the same and observe the checkout behaviour in this case.;;;","12/Dec/23 6:43 AM;bharath.krishnamurthy@vodafone.com;[~pallavi.chaudhari1@vodafone.com]

Hi Pallavi,

 

Similar email was sent last week, and the mentioned issue was resolved after the latest pcat import.

So, this is not OSE issue but pcat issue.

Please find the email attachment for the same.

 

[^Re SIT1  Wave 8.2  TelesalesRetail  OS-48633 For SOHO private with RV for cable order getting error on checkout.pdf]

 

 

 

Regards

Sunil;;;","07/Dec/23 3:38 PM;simon.auch@vodafone.com;I checked the logs provided and don't think this is a cable issue, or at least that we need more information to debug it.

The image provided shows an error message that is usually triggered by so called ""compatibility rules"", rules provided by us, but executed by the OSE rules engine.

The error message starts with ""Es ist nur möglich 0 produkte"" which usually means it is triggered by a compatibility rule with the operation ""MAX(0)"". The conditions of all rules with this operation are:
{code:java}
  serviceSourceExpression: cart.containsProduct('UNITYPREVENTIONKIP')
  serviceSourceExpression: cart.containsProduct('UNITYPREVENTIONTV')
  serviceSourceExpression: cart.containsProduct('3PDROPREQUIREDKIP') and !cart.containedProductInCategory('CABLE->CABLE_TV->SKY')
  serviceSourceExpression: cart.containsProduct('3PDROPREQUIREDTV') and !cart.containedProductInCategory('CABLE->CABLE_INTERNET_PHONE->3P Vorteil')
  serviceSourceExpression: cart.containsProduct(""UMEKUDBLOCKER"")
  serviceSourceExpression: cart.containsProduct(""KIPCHANGEDMARKERFORKUD"") and !cart.containsProduct(""KIPOPENEDMARKER"")
  serviceSourceExpression: cart.containsProduct(""KUDCHANGEDMARKERFORKIP"") and !cart.containsProduct(""KUDOPENEDMARKER"")
  serviceSourceExpression: '!cart.containsProduct(""OMNIUSTVCHANGEDMARKER"")'
  serviceSourceExpression: '!cart.containsProduct(""OMNIUSKIPCHANGEDMARKER"")'
  serviceSourceExpression: '!cart.containsProduct(""OMNIUSKUDCHANGEDMARKER"")'
  serviceSourceExpression: cart.containsNbaIndicator(""KIP-TW"") and !cart.package.isTariffChanged(){code}
According to the logs the cart does not contain UNITYPREVENTIONKIP, UNITYPREVENTIONTV, 3PDROPREQUIREDKIP, 3PDROPREQUIREDTV, UMEKUDBLOCKER, KIPCHANGEDMARKERFORKUD, KUDCHANGEDMARKERFORKIP.

This leaves us with the 4 conditions:
{code:java}
serviceSourceExpression: '!cart.containsProduct(""OMNIUSTVCHANGEDMARKER"")'   serviceSourceExpression: '!cart.containsProduct(""OMNIUSKIPCHANGEDMARKER"")'   serviceSourceExpression: '!cart.containsProduct(""OMNIUSKUDCHANGEDMARKER"")'
serviceSourceExpression: cart.containsNbaIndicator(""KIP-TW"") and !cart.package.isTariffChanged() {code}
Of which the first three seem likely to trigger the message as they are not present in the cart according to the log.

These products however should be selected automatically if anything changed in the package.
I also noticed that in the screenshot and in the logs you have ""01H:B06"" selected, which is not actually a valid product anymore with the product setup version V2310_2023_11_00_088.

This lets me believe that the issue is with a mismatch between the cable rules plugin version you are executing and the cable rules plugin version expected be the product configuration you have imported. Thankfully our logs contain the cable rules plugin information as well and according to the logs you are executing a cable rules plugin from version V2270_2023_07_00_038_D02.;;;","07/Dec/23 3:41 PM;horst.froehlich@vodafone.com;As per my understanding *this couldn't be a PCAT cable issue* because PCAT cable is unchanged since more than 2 weeks and most current version - which is also in PROD - is available on SIT1.
Please check with TechM and Amdocs what might have been changed in software which maybe caused the problem.;;;","08/Dec/23 12:53 PM;pallavi.chaudhari1@vodafone.com;[~sunil.kumar3@vodafone.com] [~bharath.krishnamurthy@vodafone.com]

This issue is solved now in SIT1.

I knew from our tester,  someone is changing product configuration(product visibility) using backoffice. Ideally that must not be done if one is not aware about what side effect it can create and what is the ideal way of doing it.
If we do any config change from Backoffice then we must clean the redis cache else for sure will have inconsistent result and inconsistency in cachings. Such manual PCAT changes ideally must not be done using BO, if it’s required as per the business need then changes should come via raw PCAT files. If changes are for temporary test, then as I said after change must need to clean redis and varnish cache to avoid any inconsistency in caching.

Imo this is the RC of this issue. So, if someone is doing then please avoid it or do the cache clean properly and then see if such issue comes again.

HI Simon,

Can you confirm what should be the customer type expected in Cable Rules input for this case?. Should we send customer type as “LEGAL_PERSON” as like we currently send for “SOHO Without RV” customer.;;;","22/Nov/23 3:43 PM;simon.auch@vodafone.com;As I also answered in the E-Mail: I cannot tell you as I was not involved in the requirement for the SOHO RV stories. Please consult with the requester of your requirement.;;;","23/Nov/23 12:36 PM;pallavi.chaudhari1@vodafone.com;Received below update from Robert 

We have discussed Vodafone internally and came to the conclusion, that we have a design gap / bug in epic OS-9066:

We have created  in this Epic a new customer type:  SOHO TYPE S with SK  / (  CustomerType =  “SOHO”  CustomerSubType = “RVPRIVATE”

In order for OSF to show  in the configurator the cable  products that are available at a certain address for THIS customer type, OSF must request the cable PLugIn  and inform the cable plugin about the customer type.

The customer type in cable plugin is called:  “LEGAL_PERSON”

WE DID NOT CONSIDER THIS
 * [@Shruti  Kanchan|mailto:SK00790019@Dynacommerce.com]  todo ASAP:  we need a correction in the software/ new user-story in Epic OS-9066 :   If customertype = SOHO TYPE S with RV, then call cable PlugInn with customer_type “LEGAL_PERSON”;;;","23/Nov/23 12:36 PM;pallavi.chaudhari1@vodafone.com;Received an update from Omnius Team

Hi Pallavi,

 

The reason for comment section not visible is due to the agent does not have ORDER_MOBILE_NOTE permission and once the permission is assigned now, I am able to see the comment section as expected.

*For example:* We searched one postpaid ban having password *“Sanity1”* and in that ban several postpaid customers are linked to each other with different password like *“test” , “demo”* and when we type the password in that window all the passwords are working and authenticated the searched ban.

Hi Deepak

 

The below is expected behavior.

The Customernumber in the authentication window is prefilled from the CustomerID node received from the CustomerSearch Service response.

In the LegacySearch if the CustomerID is not available it will fetch from GlobalID and in your case the linkedcustomerid is received in the response which is prefilled and also I am not sure in real time Linked Customer id’s will be part of legacy search.

As discussed on call, as per the {*}OS-38940{*}–{*}“{*} *The list of Mobile BANs should be initially collapsed (closed) by default, showing only summary information (Number of subscribers, in case of Market category = MMO – Display prepaid”.* When we search the customer and check that in new window the ban’s are displayed in ascending order in which we have one prepaid ban which is 200000062 for order 1 and the second prepaid ban 2273250 which is at the last of all the bans. In that window for prepaid ban when it is not at the last order then it also displayed the subscriber number and expand the window and when at last order it is collapsed like other bans like below SS.

As per the *OS-39386* –“If 1 or more subscribers are selected under 1 or more BANs when the ""WEITER"" button is clicked, the customer's 360-degree view must display with the selected subscribers and corresponding BANs by default, along with the {*}fixed net (Cable, DSL, TV) accounts and prepaid subscribers{*}”. When we perform the same activity “Search *Cable or DSL* account with 1 or more mobile BANs with *prepaid account* are linked with it” we are getting below result:

 

When we search the customer either Cable or DSL and click on the search button the new popup window is opened like below SS. When we check that window, the prepaid ban is already checked, and we can’t uncheck that ban, we also select another ban and click on the WEITER button and check in main product catalog the other selected ban ,DSL , CABLE customer are loaded successfully. However, the prepaid ban is not loaded in product catalogue. Moreover, when we checked the OGW logs in MODE2 the prepaid ban is coming in GetCustomerDetails but when we checked the OMNIUS logs in Request the ban is coming, however, it’s missing in Response for MODE2.

 

Can you please check this ?

Hi Deepak

I am not sure what do you mean by in OGW GetCustomerDetails prepaid ban is coming?

As per the attached Mode2 Response log from OGW I don’t see any information related to the prepaid BAN.

Please check with OGW team on this is not an omnius issue.

There is a design gap hence I will be raising a CR to mitigate this gap from Omnius side to send only prepaid BAN in request for Mode 2.

When we search the MSISDN with in a linked ban and check the new window only linked ban is preselected not the subscriber which we searched and the associated BAN is not also expanded and prechecked.

We have retested the activity and still we are facing the issue, when we searched with MSISDN, it opened the new pop-up window. However, when we checked nothing is preselected neither the selected subscriber nor the linked ban also the BAN is not expanded.

As per the *OS-39387* –

 

“If the Flag MaxCust is set to 'YES' then,

 
 * Enhance the system to Modify the ""WARENKOERBE & ANGEBOTE"" functionality in the 360View to restrict the loading of the shopping carts and offers based on loaded subscribers from the mode 2 response.
 * System to show an error message to notify the agent when attempting to access an offer/Shopping cart which includes subscribers that are not loaded to 360 view.”

 

Also, it’s mentioned that the flag MaxCust has been set when the WEITER button is pressed.

 

However, when we performed the same legacy search activity whereas we have multiples customer which is linked with linked id *LK_2658* and select the ban which is not part of the shopping cart or offers and press the WEITER button and check the WARENKOERBE & ANGEBOTE the offers or shopping cart are displayed without any error message.

 

Can you please check this?

Hi Deepak

 

I could not verify with the offer given from your end as it is already expired.

If I am not wrong, you are expecting that the offers/carts related to the not loaded subscribers should not be shown in 360 view but this is not the requirement as per the requirement it states that you should not be able to load the offer or cart of the subscriber which is not loaded and I have checked this scenario which is working fine as expected.

Please find the screenshots for the same.

As per the *OS-39386* -“ If 1 or more BAN(s) and no subscribers are selected when the ""WEITER"" button is clicked, the customer's 360-degree view *should display with the selected BAN(s) and the first subscriber* under these BAN(s) by default along with the fixed net (Cable, DSL, TV) accounts and prepaid BANs/subscribers must also be opened.” However, when we performed the same activity legacy search customer and select only ban without subscriber and click on the WEITER button *it’s displayed all the subscriber instead of only first subscriber.*

 

Could you please check this or clarify further?

Hi Deepak

 

I have retested the scenario by selecting the first 2 bans for which each has 2 subscriptions and see that from omnius side we are sending correctly in the Mode2 request when only bans are selected i.e. we are sending the ban and the first phone number but from OGW we are receiving 1 more msisdn related information due to which as in the below screenshot you can see 2 subscriptions for 2 bans in 360 view.

Please check the Mode2logs attached for the same and please check with OGW on this.

Hi Dimitriou,

 

The address shown in the UI is fetched from the validate address response from OGW.

Which you can see in the below OGW response shared by you.

Please check with OGW or Backend teams if you are expecting the same address in the response as in the request.

 ;;;","25/Oct/23 10:51 AM;petros.dimitriou@vodafone.com;Issue escalated to blocker as we can only select online ident on frontend.

When trying to validate online identification the order is not moving forward and is stuck on Pending-OnlineIdentification status, even if we are getting success response in SOAP.

Hi Deepak Batham,

 

In sit1 I can see first time OGW response is taking too much time, around 2 min. that’s why we are getting gateway timeout error. please find the archive log screenshot
 * 6.15 request triggered but response getting after 2 min

 hence this is ogw issue. they need to check.;;;","19/Oct/23 11:52 AM;deepak.batham@vodafone.com;Hi Parth,

As discussed on call, when we search the customer on first time we are getting same issue gateway time out error on load customer please find the attached logs for the same.

[^WS_19_10_Searchcustomerlegacy.txt];;;","19/Oct/23 1:41 PM;deepak.batham@vodafone.com;Hi Parth, 

As discussed on call, we performed the same activity again and still we are getting same issue.

Please find the attached new logs.

 

[^NEW_WS_19_10_Searchcustomerlegacy.txt] ;;;","20/Oct/23 10:16 AM;parth.dwivedi@vodafone.com;We can  see as we increase the number of subscriber to search in Mode 2. Response time from KIAS increases  to fetch customer details per subscriber.

Which in turn is increasing OGW response time

We are seeing here time difference of almost 3 minutes per subscriber when we are searching for 9 subscriber.

I am attaching snip from the logs.

!image-2023-10-20-13-44-56-674.png|width=749,height=133!

 

This is something that needs to be checked with KIAS team why is taking this much time to search customer details  per subscriber as we increase the subscriber count in mode 2 reponse.

Also we have seen when we try to search less subscriber in mode 2 we get proper results.

Hi Pallavi,

There is no BO settings to show tariffs in configurator, if the tariffs are not visible for Soho Private RV then this should be checked with pcat team to see why cable tariffs are not visible for Soho Private RV customers might be if there are no tariffs or rules in pcat which support Soho Private RV customers.;;;","12/Oct/23 12:42 PM;pallavi.chaudhari1@vodafone.com;This issue needs to be check by PCAT team so moving from Omnius to PCAT;;;","17/Oct/23 2:58 PM;simon.auch@vodafone.com;[~pallavi.chaudhari1@vodafone.com] can you please provide us with the cable rules logs from the SIT1 environment for such a session?

the log you provided is unfortunately not the one we need. The name usually starts with ""cable_rules_artifact"" and it is not an xml file.

I did know what the Version on the SIT1 is, but OSE versions are usually uploaded to a jfrog artifactory ([https://artifactory.vodafone.com/)] which we can then use for local testing. The version you mentioned is not there, so we cannot use it for testing.
If you can provide the OSE version in the jfrog artifactory, we might be able to investigate this easier.

Hi [~deepak.batham@vodafone.com] 

We can see on mode 1 response there is no {_}*RetrieveCustomerInfo/Customer/SubscribersCoun*{_}{*}t{*} node for a Customer, which give count of current customer’s ban subscriptions.

Also _*RetrieveCustomerInfoResponse/Customer/Contract/Subscription/Ctn/*_ node which give actual subscription data to show on new UI popup window.

I would suggest arrange call to check the same.

As requested by developer arranged call at 2:30 Pm IST on 11/10/2023

Hi [~deepak.batham@vodafone.com]  this looks environment php memory issue same was observed during out call for the same issue. Looks customer loaded is having huge customer data on subscription level which is leading to this looks.

And in our EPIC we don't have any changes on customer 360 and it should work as BAU. So Please provide latest  mode logs of the customer so that we can test in our env once.

This CR defines the technical requirements for integration of a secrets management tool, here 3rd party tool Harshicorp Vault, from Amdocs side. This tool will be used with Sky application delivery process and CI/CD pipeline in the future. The goal is to manage the handling of credentials in the pipeline by separation of passwords from Amdocs delivery. The credentials are stored securely in secrets management tool, that only the environment responsibles (persons/roles) can view and control the credentials for a target environment.

CR target date is R7.2 release / *GoLive 12.2.2023* (PROD security demand).

Amdocs analyzed, that integration of secrets management tool is do-able, but require many code changes so Amdocs will require CR to start the work. Technical requirements to be implemented by Amdocs:
 * REQ-01: Setting some template to use for the 3 secrets required
 * REQ-02: Access to vault (probably requires some authentication) on helm script. 
 * REQ-03: Getting the secrets (probably retrieved via ArgoCD vault plugin resp. API)
 * REQ-04: Parsing the secrets into yamls. Refer to documentation Url [https://argocd-vault-plugin.readthedocs.io/en/stable/]
 * REQ-05: Deploy the secrets
 * REQ-06: Checking all references for secrets in Amdocs code to make sure no changes required
 * REQ-07: New secrets management solution should be documented within credential/certicates renewal process

 

+Note (A.Kulkarni):+ Kubernetes configuration for Harshicorp Vault integration requires to replace the ArgoCD interface with the ArgoCD Vault interface. Can be provided on short term.

+Note (Y.Majeti):+ CR requires dedicated SIT+ACC environment for implementation and testing including vault integration.

It was commited, that Amdocs shall start CR process with cost estimation / feasibility date. Any impediments caused by non-availabiliy of environments need to be evaluated during CR execution and may result in timeline correction.
