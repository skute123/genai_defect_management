Hi PallaviAnurag,

 

SIT1: issue with DB pointing to localhost. Resolved after pointing back to old DB server.

SIT2: Updated auto increment ID for SIT2 and its started working. PFA document for queries executed and logs.

SIT3: Already updated 21.01.2025 and now its started working.

 

Lets observer these issues and we don’t know the root cause. As an preventive action we changed the password of the SIT server to restrict server access.;;;",,,,,,,,,,,

Hi Anurag,


I checked the logs. As far as I can see, we are talking about 440464 Order. Everything looks fine from OIL point of view. This could be an intermittent issue. May I ask you to check this one more and share the I09 logs as well as the exact time frame if the same happens.;;;","31/Dec/24 8:55 AM;anurag.vaid@vodafone.com;Hi Bharath,
I have retried the order and again get the following output :

Hi Chahat,

 

As far as I can see from today`s logs, the matter is in the OGW Response. In case we have ContractSummaryInd as false we are unable to see contract summary page. In todays I09 logs it is set as false. So, we wont be able to see contract summary page.

Could you please provide another OGW Response with true as a value for ContractSummaryInd field?;;;","19/Dec/24 1:41 PM;pallavi.chaudhari1@vodafone.com;10000997 this sales ID configured and working fine now

We checked with OGW developer about this, and he confirmed that we had a condition in the code that only triggers emails to OM if multiSIMADDExists = false; otherwise, it won't.

Hi Sundhashu,

Is this *Reference_saleschannel_mapping* file ** is ** present in the daily *cron job* running process as a part of automation or is it missed?

instead of importing this single file as a manual process then this should be a part of Test data pre-requisite for the Test case execution.

I tried running one telesales Mobile New ACQ scenario with Stone tariff in SIT2 but getting below error for second MaintainEID call.

Seems like OGW is using same serial number in both the MaintainEID request.

Hi All,

For the OSE Import process the available sandboxes (who have the import process) can be used.
When the deployment is requested, the required PCAT from a sandbox can mentioned too. We will then publish/import this PCAT into the environment after deployment. Always run the import on the sandbox only. Consider extra deployment time. Make sure all details are included.

[~gaurav.chauhan4@vodafone.com] 

Could you please check and confirm on this over email chain for further steps to proceed;;;","30/Oct/24 2:09 PM;bharath.krishnamurthy@vodafone.com;[~anurag.vaid@vodafone.com] , [~pallavi.chaudhari1@vodafone.com]

Hi All ,

 

As finalized with Rob and Andrey .

 

+Issue : - OGW is not able to identify the relevant OrderLine for which the device has been handed out to customer in VORAS shop part of ShiptoStore scenario .+

 

2 possible flavors here ,
 # Order have single Orderline applicable for eSIMPush.
 # Order have more than one order lines applicable for eSIMPush .

 

+Scenario -1 : -+ 

Should and can be handled by OGW directly as part of this defect .

 

While receiving SetOrderStatus from VORAS VORAS_FINAL_SUCCESS_SHIP_TO_STORE_HANDOUT , loop over the entire order to identify the OrderLine having eSIMPush

/CDM/Customer/Subscriber/Target/Attributes/Attribute[Code=ESIMPush] = 'YES'

 

IF,

We don’t have any such OrderLine.

              Then, Do nothing.

Else,

If ,

We have more than one

Then, Do nothing.

Else,

Use the OrderLine to use further for eSIMPush Process.

 

+Scenario -2 : -+ 

 

Will be handled as part of DF -Phase3 epic.

 

Probable solutions hint:

              +Solution- 1:+
 # Omnius will send the OrderLine(s) towards SAP and then SAP will send it subsequently towards VORAS.
 # VORAS will forward OrderLineID over SetOrderStatus call to connect between exact order line.
 ## We will also need to remove the code we are building part of solution 1.

 

+Solution- 2:+
 # Voras will call GetOrder to connect between OrderLineID and the device ID.
 # VORAS will forward the OrderLineID over SetOrderStatus call to connect between exact order line.
 ## We will also need to remove the code we are building part of solution 1.;;;","14/Jan/25 7:41 AM;pallavi.chaudhari1@vodafone.com;Working fine;;;",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This usually indicates an issue in OSF. As it only happens when a new package should be openend (Broadvision tariffs), maybe there is a regression in the logic for automatically opening packages?

Hi Gaurav and Pallavi,

 

We investigate it  and observed that it seems to be issue with OSE not 100% sure since debugging log also not give much clue why so

In that circumstance we should go for latest W9.1 OSE build deployment consider same as that of ACC1 i can say and check there after if required we can use that ACC1 PCAT too here as well.(It is verified and working fine)

 

Please advise when we can do that  today ?

For the order line with StoneTariff marked as “Y”, the SIM card type is “N”, indicating a physical SIM. Therefore, a virtual SIM is not applicable in this case.

However, we also do not see a SimSerialNumber for this order line.

That is correct for eSIM there will be no SIMSerial Number sent as it is a virtual SIM

For Stone tariff again there is a correlation with main Ultracard but stone tariff in itself does not have SIMSerial Number;;;","01/Oct/24 9:57 AM;sudhanshu.shekhar@vodafone.com;[~bharath.krishnamurthy@vodafone.com] I think there is some confusion here, we had discussed this in the call as well.
Omnius is sending SIMTYPE as N for eSIM, that's why OGW is not assigning serial number from Virtual SIM.

As discussed on call with the VF Design team - Robert Göbbels (VF) & Gaurab Mitra (OGW/Amdocs). Omnius does not need to send SIMCard = E for StoneTariff as the agreement during design was that we only send StoneTariff = Y for activation of eSIM on Stone tariff OrderLine/Package which would be an indicator for OGW to request for a dummy SIM number for Stone Tariff from KIAS.

Hi Pallavi ,

We have identified 2 issue on SIT4
 # Software version was no showing - This issue fixed (Root cause Symlink created for APP version file was invalid)- We have created the file manually to make it work.

 # Stone tariff’s not visible on Configurator - For this issue after some analysis we observed some PCAT data missing on database. Kindly check below screenshot where *reference_saleschannel_mapping* data is empty. Kindly correct this by running sales channel mappping reference data import.

Perform this activity and let us know still issue persist.

pls fetch the certificate chain from de0074ls server to SAP and then extract the VF-Internal-CA (intermediate) certificate of it and place it into trust cert location of edofc47/65.

Should quickly resolve the issue now that you have confirmation about updated cert probably signed by new VF-Internal-CA (valid till 2029).

We had updated same on Vf side for couple of modules, so hopefully should solve here as well.

EAI team is working on this now;;;","24/Sep/24 2:43 PM;sudhanshu.shekhar@vodafone.com;After EAI team updated the certificate, it is working fine now.

NOTE- {*}For sim only Tariff , it is by default applicable for ACQ{*}. but here the flow is mentioned D2C(MIGCOC).

For D2C(MIGCOC)it is not possible to do SIM ONLY.

Hi Pallavi,

SimOnlyTariffInd indicator should show as “true” for the selected tarrif only. I can see it is showing in both logs. for others it should show as false because ESIMPUSH checkbox has not been captured for those tarrifs.

I can see SKU for the simonly tarrif which reporter has selected and placed the order.

Hi Pallavi

Based on your comments mentioned below
 
 {{We have already checked with OGW team and below are the findings:-They have checked and found that the order was already created with same omnius order id in past .
Because the duplication of OmniusOrderId this issue is occurring}}
Omnius began sending a duplicate order from OGW`s perspective.

As far as I remember, last time we had such an error. The OGW DB Team was going to do some cleanup activities. After these activities everything was fine and orders become unique.



May I ask you to check this topic on OGW DB Team:
1. How old are these orders?

2. Is there any way to clear old orders?

 

Could you please check with OGW DB team on this issue.;;;","12/Jul/24 1:27 PM;pallavi.chaudhari1@vodafone.com;Omnius team created auto increment for all sit1, sit3, and sit4 as a workaround

Hi [~pallavi.chaudhari1@vodafone.com] ,
In ProcessOrderRequest SALES_PHASE provided for <dlc:SkuID>R623.5000000523-24,FTTH-L2-BSA</dlc:SkuID>. But we do not have such SkuID in the ProcessOrderRequest in <dlc:CommercialProduct>. That`s why we do not send it to OGW.

!image-2024-07-03-15-18-48-383.png!

When we create the Request to OGW: for each CommercialProduct (from ProcessOrderRequest) we`re looking for the appropriate SkuID in the Component and  if we have SALES_PHASE\rollout_status etc  we create them under OGW CommercialList as SystemAdditionalData.

In SIT1 example we have a list of  SkuID  as one SkuID
<dlc:SkuID>R623.5000000524-24,FTTH-L2-BSA</dlc:SkuID>
I think these values should be splitted.
We`ve already had such kind of issue and it was resolved by providing the new pcat by Marco.;;;","03/Jul/24 1:12 PM;pallavi.chaudhari1@vodafone.com;received below update from Marco 

if we are going to change it, it would be a multimapper fix.

But for further processing the commercialist is not used.

I’ll discuss it internally if we should fix it or not (as this parameter was already in previous phase).;;;","03/Jul/24 4:51 PM;marco.abraham01@vodafone.com;That's currently the implementation in production and we don't have any issues with that as OGW doesn't care about the commercialList in submitORder.

 

And from backend order perspective the SALES_PHASE belongs to component 6.;;;",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Seems cable artifact file is missing or might be something is wrong in that file.

Needs to be checked with cable PCAT time.
