I have checked above comment from Ankesh  with @marcin (our oil team) expected SkuId instead of SkuID. Recently we changed the mapping, from SkuID to SkuId it means OGW is out of date please update OGW otherwise that request would fail the validation on OIL level and sending it towards OGW would be suppressed 

 

Thank you :);;;","05/Oct/23 12:55 PM;ankesh.anurag@vodafone.com;Hi [~vikash.saurav@vodafone.com] , 

When this change has been done? can you please share the userStory because as far as we have been communicated from 8.1 and onwards it should be 'SkuID' instead of 'SkuId'.

Hi Pallavi,

please check the below comments
 # GenerateContract request issue is fixed, we can able to see the ROLLOUT SATUS(Only in reatil As per the user story) node.

 # But in the fulfilment request issue with multi mapper. I can see ROLLOUTSTATUS(dyna_multi_mapper_addons) only one service expression cart.containsProductInCategoryId('FN2') == true , order.containsProductInCategoryId('FN0454') == true service expression is missing. hence its a pcat issue(multi mapper) please check with pcat team.

Hi Shruti,

we had a discussion about this topic with the design team.

The result is, that the rollout-status is not needed in the submit.

 

[@Vikas Kumar, Vodafone (External)|mailto:vikas.kumar@vodafone.com] [@Metin Celik, Vodafone|mailto:Metin.Celik@vodafone.com]: Can you please confirm it (see our discussion on August 18{^}th{^} and 21{^}st{^});;;","06/Sep/23 12:57 PM;pallavi.chaudhari1@vodafone.com;Received latest confirmation from Metin as below 

There seems to have been some confusion. We do not need this for the Telekom EPIC (not requested). With the DG Epic it is requested to send them.

OMNIUS towards OGW will send the rollout status (for output management) but towards the backend (COM) the rollout status will not be submitted;;;","07/Sep/23 1:52 PM;pallavi.chaudhari1@vodafone.com;Latest update over the mail for this as below  :-

TechM should be able to deploy there fix for test on SIT4.

Momentarily it looks like that the Multimapper setting for Output Management is sufficient because status is not needed in submit.

If this will be changed later and it is also needed for submit this change can be done only via Multimapper settings.;;;","08/Sep/23 1:51 PM;pallavi.chaudhari1@vodafone.com;To Retest this issue we required correct Stub path for SIT4 env and Omnius team Will update us  on this today or Monday;;;","11/Sep/23 1:29 PM;pallavi.chaudhari1@vodafone.com;* New correct Stub URL is provided by Omnius team and It’s working fine for now .

This could be an issue related to the database. What you can try first is to do a full reindex, clear the cache of the application and of the browser as well and retest  the scenario  again.;;;","19/Jul/23 9:56 AM;bharath.krishnamurthy@vodafone.com;[~sudhanshu.shekhar@vodafone.com] 

Hi Sudhanshu,

 
Daniela Sterian added a comment -
 
 We tried to reproduce this issue on multiple branches on local env with the catalog that you provided, but we can not manage to reproduce it. What we have observed is that during the new ACQ of cable package the attached error is triggered during getRules ajax call and based on that error we assume that this is a problem related to cablerules artifact.

 ;;;","19/Jul/23 5:38 PM;simon.auch@vodafone.com;Related to the error observed by comment https://jira.sp.vodafone.com/browse/OS-40559?focusedId=2859123&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels:comment-tabpanel#comment-2859123 that indicates a problem from the cables rules:

the version V2270_2023_07_00_038_D02 you are using is a development version that was provided by cable to OSF to test the development of NBA enhanced. If the OSF version on the environment does not implement the required interface changes it is expected to fail.

 

Related to the availability:

The availability for the given address ([https://wss-vf-dev1b.kabeldeutschland.de/VkdGatewayService/address/891367/availability?portal=OFT)] on the SIT1 backend (dev1b) is equal to the availability of the ACC1 backend (test1b) [The HAL Browser (kabeldeutschland.de)|https://wss-vf-test1b.kabeldeutschland.de/VkdGatewayService/hal-browser/browser.html#https://wss-vf-test1b.kabeldeutschland.de/VkdGatewayService/address/891367/availability?portal=OFT].

On the ACC1 however the availability is displayed correctly by OSF, so I don't think this is related to the availability itself.

 

It could be that OSF fails to display the availability if the cable plugin crashes, although I'm not sure why OSF would call the cable plugin before opening any package of the customer in the first place.

As it stands I don't see a reason why this is caused by an issue on the cable side. If the SIT1 environment does not contain a OSF version with the required NBA enhanced changes, then the Cable PCAT with version V2270_2023_07_00_038_D02 should not be used.;;;","20/Jul/23 11:21 AM;horst.froehlich@vodafone.com;[~gaurav.chauhan4@vodafone.com]  - Please check the system.

Hi All,

 

Tried to perform mobile Postpaid ACQ flow on both Telesales and Retail channel, still we could not able to find HW and Tariff details on configurator page even after Importing PCAT from SB2 to SIT1

 

cleared OSE cache from Back office and browser cache and then retested the scenario, still same issue persists.

This epic implements the use of the service PIN for Retail for Consumer cable customers (excluding converged/linked customers).

The service PIN is a 6-digit numerical code to authenticate cable customers. Customers have to be able to provide a randomly selected 2 digits from the stored PIN in order to be deemed authenticated. The logic for storing the PIN and requesting the random digits is provided by the Service PIN Engine (SPE). The functionality is similar to the Kundenkennwort change as implement in Fasttrack. The main difference is that for the Mobile Kundenkennwort, OSF determines the digits to be selected whereas here the SPE steers this flow. 

The SPE itself will be introduced within a separate project for the cable care hotline with a technical go-live in October 2022 (PPM ID 545188: Hotline Authentification Improvement).

The Service PIN shall be introduced in a phased approach based on BfDi priorities. The first steps related to this demand is:

Introduction Service Pin in Cable - B2C Sales in OSF
 

 

Current situation
Today we don’t have a safe / secure authentication method for cable customers because we don’t have a spoken password (Kundenkennwort) as we do have it for Mobile and DSL.

The agent only has the work instruction to ask for following attributes and the customer must correctly indicate 3 out of the 4 options.

Customer number
Postcode of the contracting party
Date of birth of the contracting party.
The last 4 digits of the IBAN.
Desired solution
For all B2C cable customers, the first method of authentication is the Service PIN. In case the service pin is incorrectly entered 2 times, the attempts are halted and the agent must use the procedural authentication as mentioned above (3 out of 4 ). 

Step 1: cable only customers (non-converged), including a cable customer linked with another cable customer  

User story steps -cable only in Retail
Happy flow
Agents searches customer data of Cable customer. The Cable customer can be a Unity Media or VKD customer, hosted in Solstice and/or other legacy systems (VKD/UM).  
OSF checks if customer has an active service PIN
SPE confirms active service PIN
OSF requests authentication for Service PIN
SPE sends Digit locations to be checked
customer provides digits
agents enters digits and sends to SPE
SPE checks digits and confirm correct authentication
System shows customer 360 View
agent continues salesflow
Alternative flow - Wrong PIN
Agents searches customer data of Cable customer
OSF checks if customer has an active service PIN
SPE confirms active service PIN
OSF requests authentication for Service PIN
SPE sends Digit locations to be checked
customer provides digits
agents enters digits and sends to SPE
SPE checks digits and denies authentication
OSF provides error info to the agent and requests to enter the PIN again
customer provides digits
agent enters digits and sends to SPI
SPE checks digits and denies authentication
OSF provides error info to the agent
Agents executes Alternative (3 of 4) authentication
System shows customer 360 view
agent continues sales flow
Alternative flow - No active PIN / No PIN set for customer
Agents searches customer data of Cable customer
OSF checks if customer has an active service PIN
SPE informs OSF that no active PIN is available for the customer.
OSF informs agent that no active PIN is available  or the PIN is not available for the customer yet.
Agent executes alternative (3 of 4)  authentication
system shows customer 360 view
agent continues sales flow
Alternative flow – SPE not available
Agents searches customer data of Cable customer
OSF checks if customer has an active service PIN
SPE is not available 
OSF informs agent that alternative authentication has to be used due to a technical issue.
Agents executes alternative authentication (3 of 4)
system shows customer 360 view
agent continues sales flow
 

Scope	 
Backends	 Wizard, Cablemaster(RNS), Solstice, UM, VKD
Customer Types	Consumer customers (including SoHo private)
Channels	Retail
 

Although only retail is in scope, other permissions that are assigned to telesales and other agents must also be taken into account as they impact the design of the new SPIN permission. For this purpose, the following rule should apply:

If the agent is forced to authenticate the customer at all and if so, at which point in the sales flow this should happen is determined by already existing permissions and functionalities outside this epic (such as: hard authentication, soft authentication, no authentication, flex authentication). The new permission for SPIN Authentication should not change that but only determine how authentication is executed when it is required. 

Related Demand:  [OSIP-1091] Correction of mTAN authentication mechanism - Vodafone Global Jira

There should not be any hardcoding done to design the flow for retail agents only. The design to restrict or allow certain agents should be based via the permissions as mentioned in OSIP-1091 and the new SPIN permission as implemented in the current Epic.

Solution Hints
Webservice spec: https://de.confluence.agile.vodafone.com/pages/viewpage.action?spaceKey=DVD&title=Service+PIN
SPE should be called from Omnius
The Full service PIN should not be stored or visualized in any front-end. 
In case the Service PIN is entered incorrectly two times, The failed attempt has to be logged.  this functionality of logging failed attempts is NOT provided by the service PIN engine and has to be implemented in the front-end. (check design for other front-ends, example: agent desktop/cable master/cockpit)
Service PIN reset is not a functionality for OSF. (can be done in agent desktop / cockpit / RNS)

This epic implements the use of the service PIN for Retail for Consumer cable customers (excluding converged/linked customers).

The service PIN is a 6-digit numerical code to authenticate cable customers. Customers have to be able to provide a randomly selected 2 digits from the stored PIN in order to be deemed authenticated. The logic for storing the PIN and requesting the random digits is provided by the Service PIN Engine (SPE). The functionality is similar to the Kundenkennwort change as implement in Fasttrack. The main difference is that for the Mobile Kundenkennwort, OSF determines the digits to be selected whereas here the SPE steers this flow. 

The SPE itself will be introduced within a separate project for the cable care hotline with a technical go-live in October 2022 (PPM ID 545188: Hotline Authentification Improvement).

The Service PIN shall be introduced in a phased approach based on BfDi priorities. The first steps related to this demand is:

Introduction Service Pin in Cable - B2C Sales in OSF
 

 

Current situation
Today we don’t have a safe / secure authentication method for cable customers because we don’t have a spoken password (Kundenkennwort) as we do have it for Mobile and DSL.

The agent only has the work instruction to ask for following attributes and the customer must correctly indicate 3 out of the 4 options.

Customer number
Postcode of the contracting party
Date of birth of the contracting party.
The last 4 digits of the IBAN.
Desired solution
For all B2C cable customers, the first method of authentication is the Service PIN. In case the service pin is incorrectly entered 2 times, the attempts are halted and the agent must use the procedural authentication as mentioned above (3 out of 4 ). 

Step 1: cable only customers (non-converged), including a cable customer linked with another cable customer  

User story steps -cable only in Retail
Happy flow
Agents searches customer data of Cable customer. The Cable customer can be a Unity Media or VKD customer, hosted in Solstice and/or other legacy systems (VKD/UM).  
OSF checks if customer has an active service PIN
SPE confirms active service PIN
OSF requests authentication for Service PIN
SPE sends Digit locations to be checked
customer provides digits
agents enters digits and sends to SPE
SPE checks digits and confirm correct authentication
System shows customer 360 View
agent continues salesflow
Alternative flow - Wrong PIN
Agents searches customer data of Cable customer
OSF checks if customer has an active service PIN
SPE confirms active service PIN
OSF requests authentication for Service PIN
SPE sends Digit locations to be checked
customer provides digits
agents enters digits and sends to SPE
SPE checks digits and denies authentication
OSF provides error info to the agent and requests to enter the PIN again
customer provides digits
agent enters digits and sends to SPI
SPE checks digits and denies authentication
OSF provides error info to the agent
Agents executes Alternative (3 of 4) authentication
System shows customer 360 view
agent continues sales flow
Alternative flow - No active PIN / No PIN set for customer
Agents searches customer data of Cable customer
OSF checks if customer has an active service PIN
SPE informs OSF that no active PIN is available for the customer.
OSF informs agent that no active PIN is available  or the PIN is not available for the customer yet.
Agent executes alternative (3 of 4)  authentication
system shows customer 360 view
agent continues sales flow
Alternative flow – SPE not available
Agents searches customer data of Cable customer
OSF checks if customer has an active service PIN
SPE is not available 
OSF informs agent that alternative authentication has to be used due to a technical issue.
Agents executes alternative authentication (3 of 4)
system shows customer 360 view
agent continues sales flow
 

Scope	 
Backends	 Wizard, Cablemaster(RNS), Solstice, UM, VKD
Customer Types	Consumer customers (including SoHo private)
Channels	Retail
 

Although only retail is in scope, other permissions that are assigned to telesales and other agents must also be taken into account as they impact the design of the new SPIN permission. For this purpose, the following rule should apply:

If the agent is forced to authenticate the customer at all and if so, at which point in the sales flow this should happen is determined by already existing permissions and functionalities outside this epic (such as: hard authentication, soft authentication, no authentication, flex authentication). The new permission for SPIN Authentication should not change that but only determine how authentication is executed when it is required. 

Related Demand:  [OSIP-1091] Correction of mTAN authentication mechanism - Vodafone Global Jira

There should not be any hardcoding done to design the flow for retail agents only. The design to restrict or allow certain agents should be based via the permissions as mentioned in OSIP-1091 and the new SPIN permission as implemented in the current Epic.

Solution Hints
Webservice spec: https://de.confluence.agile.vodafone.com/pages/viewpage.action?spaceKey=DVD&title=Service+PIN
SPE should be called from Omnius
The Full service PIN should not be stored or visualized in any front-end. 
In case the Service PIN is entered incorrectly two times, The failed attempt has to be logged.  this functionality of logging failed attempts is NOT provided by the service PIN engine and has to be implemented in the front-end. (check design for other front-ends, example: agent desktop/cable master/cockpit)
Service PIN reset is not a functionality for OSF. (can be done in agent desktop / cockpit / RNS)

*PRECONDITIONS:*
1.Agent should not have soft authentication permission.
2.Agent has SPIN and FLEX permission.

OS-13839: Part 1: SOL1SE30 - SE-030 New sales of cable internet product via www lines (MVP) Part 1 until the end of the checkout - Vodafone Global Jira
h3. Desired Situation this EPIC

Enable the fulfilment capability so that the new Solstice customers ( which can be captured by the capability built by OS-13839) can be activated correctly through the Solstice backend processes. In general, the following should be enabled:
 * Send the product data configured by the agent in OSF configurator
 * Send the new checkout data which is required by the backend for the fulfilment of the orders related to the Solstice customers
 * Using of the specified solstice order structure (composite order interface)
 * Set order status for solstice orders
 * Update meta data for ContractSummary in OneDMS

h3. {color:#de350b}*Submit order:*{color}

Send the product related information for the technical provisioning. 

Send the checkout data which is required by the backend for the fulfilment of the orders related to the new Solstice customers:
 * required data for submit for the activation in Solstice 
 ** incl. red Sales ID
(Red sales id (VOID) should be send to Solstice as commissioning related sales id.)
 ** Delivery addresses for the hardware delivery need to be part of the composite order
 ** Payment details and customer data need to be part of composite order
 ** *VF-ID!!!* (OS-12220) Status 06.10. according to the current solution, the email address will be verified while confirming the contract summary in one click from the contract summary email. Therfore the VF-ID will be generated afterwards and internal ID of the VF-ID/eMail should be written into the composite order. (tbc if this should be included in this epic or in OS-12220)
 ** The region information (the contracting party of the customer VKD or UM) for the service address (UM footprint) should be part of the composite order for the new ACQ scenarios (it is sufficient to deliver a flag/indicator so that Solstice can differentiate between VKD and UM- sending 3 different values for UM-regions is not necessary)
 ** Order overview should be analysed regarding the display of ""Neuer Anschluss"" section and customer contact details (phone number type Telefon1 (only mobile) & Telefon 2 (mobile or fixedline)) and nationality (tbc)

The customer account id (incl. further customer and product data) shall not be written/persisted to/in the OGW index (-> might be covered via Sol0 - tbc)

h1. TO BE Situation

This project is very similar to FTTH Wholebuy Telekom (see OS-17997). Some FTTH parts can be reused, other parts need newly implemented and other FTTH parts need a change.

*A. Product Catalogue (Ruling):*
 * {color:#172b4d}Reuse existing sales package category 'DSL & Glasfaser Produkte' (for FttH). Respective products will need to be added to these categories. VFP and prio result must indicate what is available.{color}
 * Product offers will be the same as the ones in the Wholebuy Telekom Epic
 ** Bandwidth will differ
 ** Hardware will differ
 * Catalogue ruling (filter, order) will be detailed out during design phase (via PPM team)
 * {color:#172b4d}Gigacombi must be posible for FttH DG{color}

*B. Availability check:*
 * {color:#172b4d}The existing icon ""{*}GLAS{*}"" should be visible on the Omnius Serviceability Bar also for FTTH-DG based on the current priority rules The color of this icon will be reflected by the ""Rollout-status""{color} value.
 * New *Access Technology* integration required; {color:#172b4d}New parameter value:{color}{color:#172b4d}FTTH-L2-BSA{color}
 * New *Access Supplier* : value {color:#172b4d}DGW to be{color} received from VFP service.
 * In case of multi supplier possibility for a customer (edge case) --> there needs to be prioritisation of supplier towards agent and customer (logic already defined in Telekom epic)
 * {color:#172b4d}'Ausbaustatus' and logic. Below table is required for FTTH Wholebuy:{color}

 

!image-2023-04-05-14-03-11-364.png!

 
 * {color:#172b4d}*Additional request for FTTH GigaGemeinde - updates in VFP result/Color*  {color}
 * Note: This is a different logic than with FTTH Telekom and FTTH Deutsche Glasfaser
 ** Order are only allowed to be placed in OSF, when they are in the 'Standard sales phase'. 
 ** If case of a different phase, OSF receives the colors '{*}{color:#de350b}RED{color}{*}' and '{*}{color:#de350b}RED{color}{*}-{*}{color:#ff8b00}ORANGE{color}{*}', and it is not allowed to place an order.

!image-2023-02-23-13-45-33-225.png|width=569,height=192!
 * {color:#172b4d}AC must show relevant detailed information after check is completed (VFP must deliver this) --> Must be analog to the Wholebuy Telekom Epic (https://jira.sp.vodafone.com/browse/OS-17997){color}
 ** Regio Klasse
 ** Project-Referenz (Tender Area)
 ** Downstream/Upstream
 ** Leitungslieferant (Access Supplier)
 ** Ausbau Status

_See below 'scribble' for required AC output information (as done for FTTH Telekom)_

!image-2023-01-25-10-30-54-736.png|width=614,height=306!

 

*C. Customer 360 view* 
 * The _Access Supplier_ of the installed base product needs to be shown in Customer 360 view window for FTTH Bitstream customers (e.g. Telekom, Deutsche Glasfaser)

*D. Product Configurator/SC*
 * Agent must be able to manually create and configure the correct Sales package with FTTH DG products from the product configurator
 ** No NBA's will be used at go-live of FTTH DG

*E. Checkout:*
 * Glasfaser-ID (Home-ID) needs to be implemented as an additional checkout field
 ** Same field required in case of FTTH DG - Can be in similar location as Telekom 'Home ID' field, but has different validation logic!

 * 
 ** {color:#172b4d}Front-end field logic: free-text field of max 21 characters (TBD. which character set to be allowed, spaces to be allowed etc{color}).
 ** Whether there is a 'Home ID' even available at the time, is dependent on the 'Ausbaustatus' of FTTH DG
 *** {color:#172b4d}IF 'Ausbaustatus' = homesPrepared, homesReady or homesConnected i.e. VFP color towards OSF = Green, there CAN BE a 'Home ID' --> Field required in checkout but OPTIONAL {color}
 ** The field should be OPTIONAL - Agent can continue sale without the value.
 *** Needs to be supplied at a later stage outside of OSF via a clearing process (similar to Telekom)
 ** {color:#172b4d}IMPORTANT: If there is no ""Home-ID"" this will affect the wishdate option! See below for logic{color}
 * {color:#172b4d}IF there is NO Home-ID entered, and the agent wants to complete the checkout/move to the next step in OSF , there needs to be a pop-up message indicating to the agent that the Home-ID field is still empty and needs to be filled if possible.{color}
 ** {color:#172b4d}Similar to required message in https://jira.sp.vodafone.com/browse/OS-17997{color}
 ** {color:#172b4d}Message only needed if Home-ID can be available (Ausbaustatus){color}

_{color:#172b4d}see below for 'Home-ID' field logic (show or don't show){color}_
|*Scenario*|*Old > New*|*Behaviour Glasfaser-ID (HOME ID) field*|
|*Acquisition*|> FTTH DG|Target tariff is FTTH DG, existing tariff is non-FTTH, hence *show* Home-ID field|
|*Move Offnet*|Cable, FTTB > FTTH DG|Target tariff is FTTH DG, hence *show* Home-ID field
Same rules apply as defined for FTTH acquisition|
|*Migration*|FTTH DG > Cable, FTTB|Target tariff is not FTTH DG, hence do not show Home-ID field|
|*Package change*|FTTH DG > FTTH DG|(Bandwidth change within same FTTH provider) Old tariff is FTTH already, hence do not show Home-ID field.

*F. Submit Order:*
 * {color:#172b4d}OGW must pass the value entered in the 'Glasfaser-ID' (Home-ID) field  to the backend in submitOrder.{color}
 * It must be accepted that value is 'empty' as Glasfaser-ID (Home-ID) can be empty in case if not available/not known
 * OGW value: In addition to Access Technology, we also need to submit the value 'Access Supplier', as there might be different legal texts. Below ID's come dynamically from the VFP, based on the VFP outcome (no hardcode):
 ** _Telekom ID: *DTAG*_
 ** _Deutsche Glasfaser ID: *DGW*_ 
 *** ID naming comes from the VFP, so content is irrelevant, mapping needs to be correct
 

 *G. Change{color:#172b4d} Scenarios{color}* 

The existing ILS, migration and move-offnet scenarios should consider the FTTH DG product and technology as well.  

 
*H. Roles & Permissions*
 * No (new) specific permissions or roles, all should be able to sell FTTH DG (Equal to Telekom Epic)
 * Ramp-Up will be controlled by VFP output and not roles/permissions
