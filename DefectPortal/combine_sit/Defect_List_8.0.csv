As discussed with  [~sudhanshu.shekhar@vodafone.com] 

Since we don’t get CallBack from OM on SIT2, document will not get generated at front-end, we need to trigger senddocumentcallback manually.

Due to some OM limitations we get CallBack from OM on SIT1 only.

The connectivity from OIL to OGW does not work properly and the {*}OGW team is working on that{*}.

OGW host name: [osf-ogw-test4.vodafone.de|http://osf-ogw-test4.vodafone.de/]

Connection to port 8002 is possible, however, the server requires a different cipher, not supported by OIL/Windows.;;;","05/Jun/23 12:08 PM;sudhanshu.shekhar@vodafone.com;A ticket has been created against VF GSD team and they are looking into it.

Hi Bhavika,

Based on the error message and the defect description it is not clear what is the issue from the OSE CheckServiceavailability Response.

{{select * from eav_attribute_option_value where option_id in ( SELECT option_id FROM eav_attribute_option where attribute_id = 132);}}
The values are coming from upgrade script not from pcat files, it is not clear how the values have been altered. However these tables are part of the pcatexport so we just restored the st9 pcat to the environments that have a problem. This way the correct attribute options are available and after running the import process again we see the issue is no longer observed.

Hi Pallavi

 

This is not a defect this is an issue with the permission assigned to the agent role due to  which it is  restricting agent to proceed further from checkout, I have removed the permission and now it is working fine as expected.

One potential impact on doing this could be that more resources are necessary / performance.

In Submit Order Request we are sending only 
*IMEI* - DATA/OrderLineList/OrderLine/SystemAdditionalData[AttributeCode=’IMEI’]/AttributeValue
*DeviceColour* - DATA/OrderLineList/OrderLine/SystemAdditionalData[AttributeCode=’DeviceColour’]/AttributeValue

Both IMEI and DeviceColour are present in the SubmitOrder logs (GenerateContract and FulFillment mode) shared by you.;;;","10/Apr/23 9:25 AM;sudhanshu.shekhar@vodafone.com;As per OGW dev, OGW is not expecting only IMEI and Device color.

They must be a Component Type as {*}Insurance{*}. And this is OGW existing functionality where Component Type Insurance is one of the pre-condition for Marsh file to be created.

Let's connect and discuss it with OGW in the call scheduled for 2 PM IST.;;;","10/Apr/23 10:47 AM;sudhanshu.shekhar@vodafone.com;Omnius team will check and analyze this issue on priority and if required they will check with their BA;;;","11/Apr/23 11:49 AM;bharath.krishnamurthy@vodafone.com;[~sudhanshu.shekhar@vodafone.com]

As the new handset insurance special SOCs CO3SD1080, CO3SD1100, CO3SD1120 and CO3SD1140 are not setup in KIAS as contract SOCs, the SQL-script in PAPS needs to be enhanced accordingly to add the component type 'HIS' also for SKUs being part of the new category 'Mobile->VODAFONE_COVER_PLUS'.;;;","11/Apr/23 4:59 PM;thomas.wermke@vodafone.com;The PCAT export below now contains the fix:

According to user story the above component field will be applicable based on certain criteria.

on that one criteria is it should be *sim only tariff + insurance product.* so its working fine according to that scenario in sit3

 

*Cart contains sim-only tariff together with new option insurance product*

I was trying to run ILS flow in retail channel of SIT3 but could not see below Insurance products available on configurator to select.

Our assumption is there might be some issue with 8.0 build which Omnius deployed yesterday on SIT3.

Because till yesterday is was working fine as we had Omnius build 7.2, after Omnius deployed 8.0 it’s not working.

Everything seems to be fine from product catalog side, please find SS below from SIT1 and SIT3.

Sales service rules conflict in rules between DTAG and GPON for Fibre products

It is satisfying with 2 rules, hence Access technology is getting added 2 times for he package type DSL

Talked with Bharath. The first issue ""Achtung
Entfernen Sie 1 Produkt vom Paketuntertyp Access_technology von Paket 1: Fixed (dies beinhaltet versteckte Produkte)."" is solved after the delivery of ""OSF-20230611_wave7_897_FN_2023_02_01"".

On 23.03.2023 New error is thrown because of DSL technology can not be determined. New Error message ""Achtung
Fügen Sie 1 Produkt im Paketuntertyp Access_technology von Paket 1: Fixed hinzu.""  is thrown. See also ""OREF-272 Umbau in PAPS auf technologieabhängige Bandbreiten"" and ""OREF-355 OSF | ACC1 | Wave 7.1 | Access Technology not visible in Shopping cart"". So this error is only happend specially on test environment, not on production.

 ;;;","28/Mar/23 4:17 PM;shuyan.luo@vodafone.com;28.03.2023 run the testcase with Bharath together on the SIT envirnoment.
And it was running fine with the address Am Seestern 430 40547 Düsseldorf .

Issue happens only if tester is using his own Mocks, with below fake data:
 !screenshot-1.png|thumbnail! 
And this issue happens because we don't have any Bandwidth 250 definition for IP Bitsteam, see also ""CRFN200 ILS: Technology IP-Bitstream obligated"" . So some years ago, as IP Bitsream goes life, the maximum bandwidth of it was 100 Mbits, till now we didn't get any change request to enhance it with higher bandwidth.

So the issue mentioned on this ticket is actually not an error. In case you want to enhance the IP-Bitstream with bandwith 250 Mbits, Let's talk to Business OnDemand Team at first.

Hi Froehlich,

 

I don’t see an issue in EAI side. EAI is receiving an error from KIAS stating that “BAN don't exist, Backend Error Code: 2”. EAI is converting the backend error code into EAI error code “EAI000056” and sending it back with Functional fault. 

It is a test data issue.

 

Need KIAS team mail distro to send a mail for further updates.

And need to assign this defect to KIAS team.

 

PF the below details and attached logs.

 

*Customer Data:*

90562750,  KS_90562750

29998667,  KS_29998667

 

 

Could you please check these data and let us know why these data are not working for customer search.

Hi Markus,

 

Retested the scenario on SIT1 ENv, Telesales channel

Now we can able to see the HW in configurator for Giga cube tariff to create a bundle package with any other product.

 

Thanks you all for your great support and providing fix

As we all know that since last week 21{^}st{^} Feb 2023 – until 28{^}th{^} Feb 2023—we had a Critical issue which blocked both SIT/ACC env –where we were facing OILàOGW timeouts due to which everything in testing was blocked.

 

Finally, after a lot of  investigations, analysis and checks –we identified the Root cause of the issue, which now has been fixed and now we aren’t getting any timeout issue on the envs.

 

Just to summarize – please do find the below RCA of the issue:-

 

{*}+Issue+{*}:- Timeout problems while connecting OILàOGW

 

*+Impact+* : All SIT/ACC Testing Env execution were blocked—Impacted SIT deliveries, Regression testing delay, Production build release delays

 

{*}+Issue occurrence reason+{*}: There was an upgrade done on the Kafka Linux servers on 20{^}th{^} Feb 2023(10PM CET) –where during upgrade all the 3 Broker nodes were also by default updated. Post upgrade by unknown reason #1 nodes Java Jdk version was upgraded to higher version than the other 2 nodes.—due to which when request was triggered to this #1 node—SSL handshake issues were encountered.

 

*+Resolution for fix:-+* #1 nodes Java JDK version was downgraded and broker node restarted.

 ;;;","06/Mar/23 9:34 AM;bhuvi.chowdhary@vodafone.com;one small correction:

 

where during upgrade all the 3 Broker nodes were also by default updated

Only 1 broker was patched not all – which causes inaccessibility of this broker.

The other 2 are NOT patched or updated.

Usually, errors of this kind are caused by OGW which is not working, unavailable, or working too slowly.

But to make sure, [@Irina Beshenko (Euvic)|mailto:irina.beshenko@euvic.pl] is just logging to the SIT servers and checking.;;;","21/Feb/23 6:50 PM;bharath.krishnamurthy@vodafone.com;[~bhavika.kohale@vodafone.com]

Hi Bhavika
In short: different data on the same machine processes in different way.

It seems like OGW can not deal with such kind of  data inside and timeout occur.

 I`ve started two ProcessOrderRequests:

first - new with ACQ

second - ILSBLU

Data inside request differs

The second one processed without any TimeOuts. The First  - TimeOut occured.

We successfully generated Send Request to OGW

Switched on NLog : FileLogger

In some cases I faced with one more error in this request. Sometimes it responds (I didn`t change the request)

Hi Marcin/Irina,

For 1{^}st{^} request what would be the next step to resolve this issue?

Please suggest.;;;","22/Feb/23 8:29 AM;bharath.krishnamurthy@vodafone.com;Marcin Jurczak

Hi Piyush,

The issue needs to be analysed on OGW side. Apparently, depending on the data, the service works different way.

Hello,

Now I made a few test calls to CheckServiceAbility service on SIT2. It appears the response time is random: from 4 trials, 2 end up with a timeout, 1 finished successfully after 42seconds, and 1 was very fast and took only 1,7s.;;;","22/Feb/23 2:48 PM;bhavika.kohale@vodafone.com;[~hrishikesh.dhakad@vodafone.com] will take up the issue of response time with the Networks teams, as for the same test data we are getting timeouts for most of the time.;;;","22/Feb/23 3:13 PM;vikash.saurav@vodafone.com;[~bhavika.kohale@vodafone.com] [~piyush.thakre@vodafone.com] [~gaurav.chauhan4@vodafone.com]  [~ketaki.bhide1@vodafone.com]

{*}+Issue+{*}:- Timeout problems while connecting OIL-OGW

 

*+Impact+* : All SIT/ACC Testing Env execution were blocked—Impacted SIT deliveries, Regression testing delay, Production build release delays

 

{*}+Issue occurrence reason+{*}: There was an upgrade done on the Kafka Linux servers on 20{^}th{^} Feb 2023(10PM CET) –where during upgrade all the 3 Broker nodes were also by default updated. Post upgrade by unknown reason #1 nodes Java Jdk version was upgraded to higher version than the other 2 nodes.—due to which when request was triggered to this #1 node—SSL handshake issues were encountered.

 

*+Resolution for fix:-+* #1 nodes Java JDK version was downgraded and broker node restarted.

 However still we have an issue ""CheckServiceAbility is failing with timeout error"". And it needs to be checked by OGW team.

Opened a new defect- OS-33236 for this issue and closing this.

As I can see from logs, OGW has not received OMSendDocumentCallback request from SBUS yet.

RCA of this defect:

There were some dependencies  not running as expected so the ROM was not working normal, so we restarted these dependencies and then restarted the OM instances so it is working fine. ;;;","13/Mar/23 3:37 PM;bharath.krishnamurthy@vodafone.com;[~bhuvi.chowdhary@vodafone.com]

As per SBUS log the document is created and received in SBUS side as you see following, so maybe required to restart OGW servers also make sure OGW connect to SBUS via HTTPs not HTTP, so please ask OGW team to restart OGW server.

I checked and compared with branch 7.2 where I found that for branch Wave8.0 most of the Stop/setup/start files are missing that’s reason deployment is getting failed. Therefore, build doesn’t contain those files and failed when script is looking for that files.

[@Joshua Grady-Share|mailto:JoshuaG@Amdocs.com]: Here, I think branch creation or branch merge for Wave8.0 was not done properly. Can we create the branch 8.0 again for o2a ? Kindly check and suggest.

Hi Pallavi

 

As per the response logs attached there are no shops available due to which you are seeing the error message in the UI.

This is expected behavior as there are no pickup locations at that address.

So please use different address where OGW/SAP sends the pickup locations in the getpickuplocation service then you will be able to see the shops in UI and able to select them.;;;","10/Feb/23 12:58 PM;pallavi.chaudhari1@vodafone.com;{*}We required test data(different address{*}) to test this functionality .Vodafone team is checking -  for the same and correct address where we can able to see the DHL store list ;;;","13/Feb/23 1:19 PM;pallavi.chaudhari1@vodafone.com;We are waiting for - to received the response from Vodafone team to provide the  test data(different address) for DHL;;;","15/Feb/23 10:52 AM;ajay.yashwantbhavar@vodafone.com;[~pallavi.chaudhari1@vodafone.com] [~piyush.thakre@vodafone.com] Can you try with 46147 as zipCode.;;;","15/Feb/23 11:39 AM;pallavi.chaudhari1@vodafone.com;Currently we are facing some deployment issue on SIT1 once It will resolved will give a try with 46147 zipcode .;;;","16/Feb/23 10:59 AM;pallavi.chaudhari1@vodafone.com;Due to OS-32058 we cant able to test with given zipcode ;;;","20/Feb/23 2:53 PM;pallavi.chaudhari1@vodafone.com;We have tried with the zip code 46147 as provided by Vodafone team but still not able to see the DHL stores for pickup selection;;;","21/Feb/23 9:48 AM;pallavi.chaudhari1@vodafone.com;We have tried with zip code 44143 as provided by VF team but still not able to see the DHL store so we have requested for complete address ;;;","27/Feb/23 10:08 AM;bhuvi.chowdhary@vodafone.com;Hi Nithi/Galal,

 ;;;","27/Feb/23 10:08 AM;bhuvi.chowdhary@vodafone.com;Hi Piyush,

 

I had a call with Ahmed, and we corrected the file. There is a logic on EAI for picking the file and sending it in response. Based on soap header input value of boid, EAI simulator picks the file and process the response. So, the file name should be in sync with boid otherwise you will get a default response.

Hi Pallavi

 

As per the attached logs we can clearly see the below error message received from OGW due to which you are not able to see any pick up location.

Please check with OGW team on this

Have investigated the issue and found that same product with different pcat on same build gives different results. From my understanding *shippingfee* related product looks to be pcat issue. thats why we are not receiving *packageSubType* node value

Now its on internal discussion with BA

will update once we receive the update from them.;;;","31/Jan/23 8:00 AM;pallavi.chaudhari1@vodafone.com;Hi [~bharath.krishnamurthy@vodafone.com] do we have any ETA for this?;;;","31/Jan/23 8:10 AM;bharath.krishnamurthy@vodafone.com;[~pallavi.chaudhari1@vodafone.com]

From my understanding and reviewing code it looks like pcat issue.. Also based on timo comment we might need to get raw pcat files as well to confirm whether pcat issue only. can we get raw pcat files to proceed further

Hi Pallavi,

Requested in mail for Raw PCAT files , once we get that files then we can check it again and confirm it as PCAT issue.

Now as per dev analysis it is not a code issue from Omnius side, looks like PCAT issue only.

For further confirmation and clarification we requested raw PCAT files on SIT1 ENV;;;","31/Jan/23 12:50 PM;bharath.krishnamurthy@vodafone.com;[~pallavi.chaudhari1@vodafone.com] , [~gaurav.chauhan4@vodafone.com]

hi [~pallavi.chaudhari1@vodafone.com] we verified the logs and see that ,in the getIdentmethod response we only receive online, door and store

hence only these 3 identmethods are shown.

If you are expecting DHLident then same should be received in getidentmethod response.

Seems like functionality are working fine. The DHL Filiale ident method is not available to select because its entry are not present in db table : *ose.ident_method*

 

After adding the entry it is available now :

++ Sunil checked SIT DB also and there entry for DHLFiliaIdent is not present so that is why you were not able to check.

Note: They need to import the reference_identmethod.xml file which has DHLfilialeident method;;;","03/Feb/23 1:31 PM;pallavi.chaudhari1@vodafone.com;As we received the new PCAT and Its working fine now;;;","08/Feb/23 11:43 AM;pallavi.chaudhari1@vodafone.com;Facing issue After OGW deployment build no :- *1732*;;;","08/Feb/23 1:35 PM;affan.baragazi@vodafone.com;The issue is resolved .vfde_get_ident_methods_handler.fxml flow is updated

SOL1SE30 - SE-030 Introduce VF-ID for consumer customers ordering products mastered in Solstice,OS-28748,2473824,Test Plan,Epic to be described,OS,"OSF wave4, wave 5 ..",software,matthias.breuer1@vodafone.com,,,4-Minor,,,bhavika.kohale@vodafone.com,bhavika.kohale@vodafone.com,06/Jan/23 8:51 AM,03/Jun/24 1:53 PM,03/Nov/25 10:45 AM,,,Wave 8.0,,,,,,Solstice,Solution_1,"h1. Goal

The VF-ID (ULM User ID) is a concept of Solstice with the goal to simplify journeys for all customer e.g. to communicate easily digital with Vodafone.

This EPIC describes the requirements for VF-ID (ULM User ID) creation. The creation of VF-ID (ULM User ID) is only relevant for *+NEW+* SOLSTICE CUSTOMERS. This EPIC does not consider existing customers. It has to be ensure, that with every new SOLSTICE order via OSF a unique VF-ID (ULM User ID) is created for the customer. The created VF-ID (ULM User ID) is a combination of firstname, lastname, salutation, eMail. (--> see detail described in “Rules for VF-ID to be create”). The provided eMail is identifying the Vodafone ID and is used for login via the credentials <eMail address> / <password>. The contact eMail address is used to fill the VF ID eMail address attribute.

The mobile contact numberis relevant for VF-ID. It has to be ensure that the customer provides a mobile contact number. In case of forgotten password the link for changing password can be provide via SMS. (will be handled via ULM Lifecycle Service Pocesses, not in scope of our EPIC)

–
*Important!:*
*With the delivered interface spec, we are not able to identify any specific technical errors!!*

*In order not to put the entire EPIC on hold, we continue with the following alternatives:*
*1. EPIC OS-12220 describes the ""validationEmail"" and ""createUserULM"" with response code ""200/201"" (Happy case). Error cases are usually not caught, which causes us to stop the process and the agent will not be able to submit the order*
*2. A new Epic is required: EPIC OS-28388 will reflect the individual error cases with their business impact.*
h1. Desired solution
 # Ordering Solctice products via OSF for NEW customers should trigger the creation of an VF-ID. As the eMail will be an mandatory part to create the VF-ID, extended checks on eMail should be done (DXL Service). 
 # During the checkout an eMail has to be provided as mandatory. This contact eMail is mandatory for VF-ID creation.
 # The eMail has to be checked for the following via DXL Service to ensure the eMail can be used as an identifier for VF-ID

 ## *Availability DXL Service: Is the service available?*
 *** {*}YES{*}: If successful - check on (2, 3 & 4)
 *** {*}NO{*}: If service is NOT available, a warning message has to be shown to the agent (e.g. “Email cannot be validated due to a technical error …”). The checkout can be proceed.
 *** DXL Service will be re-triggered and the email check will be done in last step before ""Vertragszusammenfassung senden"" --> (described in US OS-25323). In case the service is still not available or failed at the end of checkout, the process will be stopped and the agent is not able to submit CS!
 ## *Unique eMail: Is this eMail unique and not already used?*
 *** *YES:* If successful - show a green arrow behind the EMail and check on (3)
 *** *NO:* If this eMail is not unique, a warning message has to be shown to the agent (e.g. “Email cannot be validated due to a technical error …”). The checkout can be proceed.
 *** DXL Service will be re-triggered and the email check will be done in last step before ""Vertragszusammenfassung senden"" --> (described in US OS-25323). In case the service is still not available or failed at the end of checkout, the process will be stopped and the agent is not able to submit CS!
 ## *Denied* *eMail: Is the EMail deny-listed?* Dummy EMail-Address (0@d2.de ) are not allowed to be use for Solstice customers (at least in Solstice Sol 1)
 *** *NO:* If this eMail is NOT denied - show a green arrow behind the EMail
 *** *YES:* If this eMail is denied, a warning message has to be shown to the agent  (e.g. “Email cannot be validated due to a technical error …”). The checkout can be proceed.
 *** DXL Service will be re-triggered and the email check will be done in last step before ""Vertragszusammenfassung senden"" --> (described in US OS-25323). In case the service is still not available or failed at the end of checkout, the process will be stopped and the agent is not able to submit CS!
 ## *Validated* *eMail: Is the EMail or domain a validate one?* Unkown eMails or forbidden domains are not allowed (!)
 *** *YES:* If successful - as today show a green arrow behind the EMail and check on (4)
 *** *NO:* If this eMail or domain is not valid, a warning message has to be shown to the agent (e.g. “Email cannot be validated due to a technical error …”). The checkout can be proceed.
 *** DXL Service will be re-triggered and the email check will be done in last step before ""Vertragszusammenfassung senden"" --> (described in US OS-25323). In case the service is still not available or failed at the end of checkout, the process will be stopped and the agent is not able to submit CS!
 # In case of a successful eMail-Check, Agent proceed with checkout
 # Agent sends CS to customer
 # customer receives email to confirm CS and verify email --> email text has to be changed by OM
 # customer confirms CS and email verification with one klick
 ** The E-Mail verification has to be done along with Contract Summary confirmation and should not be requested via separate email. For this reason in Solstice Sol 1 the Contract Summary can only be confirmed via the confirmation Link in the E-Mail with the contract summary and not via a Voice-File. This rule has to be checked again in further phases
 # ULM User will be created

 
h1. Rules for VF-ID to be create

Customer information to be provided for the Vodafone ID creation are: (Standard entry from the checkout)
 * Salutation
 * First name
 * Last name
 * EMail-Address (Username)
 * optional: Mobile Phone number

The provided EMail address is identifying the Vodafone ID and is used for login via the credentials <eMail address> / <password>, hence set as the Username (Benutzername) for the Vodafone ID. The contact EMail address is used to fill the VF-ID eMail address attribute.

Scope of this epic is the implementation of a new identification method: ""DHL filial ident"".  This is needed to reduce the fraud risk for door-ident for high value mobile hardware and improves the customer experience to identify and pick up his hardware.  By offering not only the VF shops as pick-up location for expensive hardware, but also DHL shops, customers will get more flexiblity.

 

1.  Determine ident method based on the value of the sum of mobile hardware in the shopping cart. currently (september 2022) this functionality is already developed (OAF-313) and is actually in production used since october 2022  see attachment identMethod_prod_27_10_2022_10_35_31.xml  and also epic OSIP-979)

2. The ident method ""DHL Filial Ident' is not implemented  yet as part of this functionality and must be available in checkout 
 * Min 0€ / Max 1.199€
 * Online-Ident
 * Store-Ident
 * Door-Ident

With value higher 1.199 EUR
 * Online-Ident
 * Store Ident

*Userstory steps*
 # Agent configures a shopping cart with mobile hardware
 # Agent proceeds to check out and gets the possible ident methods displayed. Ident methods are partially determined by the mobile hardware value in the shoppingcart. (the value vs allowed ident methods is documented in the xml file:  reference_Identmethod<datetimestamp>.xml.
 # Agent selects the ident method based on the allowed methods and his preference. 
 # OSF offers the possible delivery methods based on the selected ident method (in this case: DHL shops that offer the ident procedure)
 # In case, that customer prefers the DHL filiale ident, OSF offer the possible DHL shop locations  
 # Agent enters customer postal code into OMNIUS to determine nearest and authorized (DHL) store.  (as today for VF filiale as delivery method)
 # Agent creates contract summary and submits the offer (as today)
 # OSF sends the order to SAP with the DHL shop as delivery address. (existing DHL ident and pickup process (like online channel))  
 # OSF sends the files to FRIDA including a new parameter:  SHOP-ID

*Scope*
|Scope element|Definition|
|Channels|Telesales, COPS|
|Line of Business|Mobile (Postpaid)|
|Process Context|BNT (New Acquisition limited to BNTs) with high value hardware|
|Volume|-|
|Customer Type|Kias Type C, S Private Customers, SOHO private
(SOHO Business customers are out of scope (KIAS TYPE B)|

 

Besides that it is requested (email 18.10 from ACXL, Christiane Mehlmann)  to send the parameter ""Location ID""  from OSF to FRIDA.

 

{color:#de350b}*Current Situation*   {color}

After some fraud cases by door ident, DHL (as supported by GLS) will cancel the door ident delivery contract with Vodafone. We could no longer ship smartphones to the home adress with identification at the front door. This will significantly harm our business in this case as we loose one ident method for high value mobile hardware.

Current implementation (planned for october 2022)
  
With a  (mobile) shopping cart value smaller than 1.199 EUR the following ident methods are available in checkout: 
 * Min 0€ / Max 1.199€
 * Online-Ident
 * Store-Ident
 * Door-Ident

With value higher 1.199 EUR
 * Online-Ident
 * Store Ident
