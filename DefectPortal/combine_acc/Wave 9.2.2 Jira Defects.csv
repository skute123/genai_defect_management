i dont see any code issue here.

can you run the same query again and after that do restart of wf? ;;;","04/Jun/25 12:36 PM;pallavi.kokate1@vodafone.com;Hi [~ran.farjun1@vodafone.com]

because in OneDMS (Scanview) document are visible so second fast search should get triggered with successfull response 
and its working fine for other legacy stack too

i can see that the flow is on stand by, meaning it waiting.

so my suggestion is to do the query, maybe even change back configuration to 2 hours and then restart;;;","04/Jun/25 1:02 PM;ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com;its happening on both ACC2 and ACC3, complete different environments but sharing the same production fix for Fusion C related to archiving. asked Rohan to support further investigation;;;","05/Jun/25 6:43 PM;rohan.kumbhar@vodafone.com;As per the analysis what i see is that we are able to trigger the FastSearch Request for 2nd time but here the problem is the 2nd request somehow is getting triggered post 22 hours

The link LK_30003302 includes two customers: one Cable and one Mobile. When searching for a Mobile customer in mode 3, BAN details are required, which appear to be missing in this case, as confirmed by the attachment. Consequently, the request is failing at the validation level before reaching CR 877. However, when searching for the individual KD customer, we receive a valid response. Can you please try adding the BAN details and then retrieve the customer. Attaching the entities and the response for reference.

Could you please check attached log from yesterday, we can see error description in mode 3 logs instead of success?

And About 2nd thing adding the BAN details we can't add it from our side it depends on OSE request but there was no change regarding this epic related to OSE;;;","15/May/25 6:38 PM;affan.baragazi@vodafone.com;Hi Krishnkumar, 
As mentioned in my earlier comment as well, the error is occurring because the link(LK_30003302) you're retrieving includes both a Mobile and a Cable customer. In Modes 2 and 3, the BanDetails field is mandatory for Mobile, so the request fails during the initial validation phase before it even reaches any downstream services. You can also confirm this in the screenshot below, which is taken from Confluence.

If we checked with other data eg :LK_13381    DSL    FN_001921483743
LK_13381    Mobile    KS_116372219
For this customer Mobile is broken and FN customer is having no issue so broken customer search should be successfull

If we search with DSL customer id :

Please check attached logs[^Mode_logs_BrokenMob.zip];;;","16/May/25 2:23 PM;affan.baragazi@vodafone.com;Hi [~pallavi.kokate1@vodafone.com],
According to this CR, if an error occurs under sublayer of GetCustomerDetails (in any API call failure towards other parties from OGW), call for any of the linked customer OGW will remove the specific customers from final response mapping. However, the error you're encountering in LegacySearch is not covered under this CR.
Also as mentioned in my earlier comments, the error _'One or more BAN and MarketCode combination must be populated in Mode #2'_ is triggered because the request fails during the initial validation phase before reaching any downstream services as BanDetails is mandatory for Mobile customers. From OGW's perspective, this behavior is aligned with the intended design.
Thanks;;;","19/May/25 11:26 AM;pallavi.kokate1@vodafone.com;Latest comment from Gaurab:



If the error is due to the incorrect input parameter and failure received from OGW validation layer, then no , if the reason of the error is exception/business error received from backend system then it should be.

Hi Pallavi,
 
I checked further and see once OSE trigger Mode 1 request along with “Global ID of customer retrieved through Search Customer”, the mode 1 response from OGW is completely empty . Looks this is the reason behind such errors.

The link LK_30003302 includes two customers: one Cable and one Mobile. When searching for a Mobile customer in mode 3, BAN details are required, which appear to be missing in this case, as confirmed by the attachment. Consequently, the request is failing at the validation level before reaching CR 877. However, when searching for the individual KD customer, we receive a valid response. Can you please try adding the BAN details and then retrieve the customer. Attaching the entities and the response for reference.

Could you please check attached log from yesterday, we can see error description in mode 3 logs instead of success?

And About 2nd thing adding the BAN details we can't add it from our side it depends on OSE request but there was no change regarding this epic related to OSE;;;","15/May/25 6:39 PM;affan.baragazi@vodafone.com;Hi Krishnkumar, 
As mentioned in my earlier comment as well, the error is occurring because the link(LK_30003302) you're retrieving includes both a Mobile and a Cable customer. In Modes 2 and 3, the BanDetails field is mandatory for Mobile, so the request fails during the initial validation phase before it even reaches any downstream services. You can also confirm this in the screenshot below, which is taken from Confluence.

If we checked with other data eg :LK_13381    DSL    FN_001921483743
LK_13381    Mobile    KS_116372219
For this customer Mobile is broken and FN customer is having no issue so broken customer search should be successfull 
but we are getting below error for it but as per CR search and retrieval should be successfull 
If we search with Mob Entity id :

If we search with DSL customer id :
!image-2025-05-16-12-27-02-048.png|width=402,height=211!

Please check logs for same [^Mode_logs_BrokenMob.zip];;;","16/May/25 2:22 PM;affan.baragazi@vodafone.com;Hi [~pallavi.kokate1@vodafone.com] ,
According to this CR, if an error occurs under sublayer of GetCustomerDetails (in any API call failure towards other parties from OGW), call for any of the linked customer OGW will remove the specific customers from final response mapping. However, the error you're encountering in LegacySearch is not covered under this CR. 
Also as mentioned in my earlier comments, the error _'One or more BAN and MarketCode combination must be populated in Mode #2'_ is triggered because the request fails during the initial validation phase before reaching any downstream services as BanDetails is mandatory for Mobile customers. From OGW's perspective, this behavior is aligned with the intended design.
Thanks;;;","19/May/25 11:26 AM;pallavi.kokate1@vodafone.com;Latest comment from Gaurab:

If the error is due to the incorrect input parameter and failure received from OGW validation layer, then no , if the reason of the error is exception/business error received from backend system then it should be.

I checked further and see once OSE trigger Mode 1 request along with “Global ID of customer retrieved through Search Customer”, the mode 1 response from OGW is completely empty . Looks this is the reason behind such errors.

Could you please check with OGW team on this. ;;;","21/May/25 2:26 PM;pallavi.kokate1@vodafone.com;Hi [~affan.baragazi@vodafone.com]

Hi Shubhangi/Pallavi,

I agree that OSE should check why BANDetails are missing in the RetrieveCustomerInfo mode=2 Request for LK_30003302.
Before doing that, it is better to check why the OGW RetrieveCustomerInfo mode=1 Response returns an error:
 
 {{[HTTPAdaptor] Can not connect to HTTP Server[wss-vf-test3b.kabeldeutsc}}
 
Perhaps, this is the case of BANDetails missing in mode=2 Request.;;;","22/May/25 12:09 PM;affan.baragazi@vodafone.com;Hi [~pallavi.kokate1@vodafone.com] ,

We are receiving error from the downstream services for both the customers linked to LK_30003302, hence we are sending an empty response which is as per the CR's design.

TL;DR: The issue observed by OSF (no products visible in configurator) was caused by an infrastructure component of the kubernetes cluster BLES runs in, not by BLES.

Requests from Omnius and IBP to BLES both had the issue that sometimes the request was rejected with a ""401 unauthorized"" error, returned by an nginx.

The path of a request from IBP/Omnius to BLES looks roughly like:
 * IBP/Omnius
 * ConHub
 * NGinx
 * BLES

The credentials for all requests to BLES are checked by the nginx instance directly in front of it and, therefore, this was not an issue with BLES.

Since the nginx checks the credentials and 401 errors are related to authorization, I checked the nginx logs. There I found errors indicating that one of the nginx pods (the nginx deployment consists of 3 pods) ran out of disk space. I then checked which pod was out of disk space and killed it, causing Kubernetes to reschedule a new pod to replace it. This fixed the issue.

Follow up steps I see for the infrastructure Teams:
 * improve monitoring for the nginx deployments
 * figure out why this pod was not detected as unhealthy by kubernetes on its own and change it
 * try to find out why the disk was full in the first place
 * retrospectively:
 ** why was it determined to not be an infrastructure issue?
 ** raise awareness for the criticality of cloud components in the system teams;;;",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Last update from KIAS Team:

Hello Andreas,

 

I think this is defined at OCCS side. Accordingly the Activation evaluation should populate.

Currently the values for External credit class and Rating reason code provided from OCCS are different than we expect in success case.

 

Current value: External credit class= X

 

Previous value: External credit class= A

 

[@Esraa Mansour, Vodafone|mailto:esraa.mansour1@vodafone.com]: Could you please check for the credit check responses sent from OCCS on INT/OPT environments.

 ;;;","22/Apr/25 4:44 PM;rohan.kumbhar@vodafone.com;as per KIAS/DXL analysis the issue seems to be related to DXL development :-

Kind regards, Andreas


DXL Comments:-
Thank you Andreas.

My understanding so far is that DXL is sending 

External credit class= X

Expected:

External credit class= A

While checking the DXL logs, I found the traceID: 05ebb2da234bfe33d84c9dfc85de89a1

DXL is really  sending 
                                               <ns2:additionalData>
                                                               <ns2:key>externalCreditClass</ns2:key>
                                                               <ns2:value>X</ns2:value>
                                               </ns2:additionalData>

This DXL request is following this schufa rating response:
### POST SOUTHBOUND REST RESPONSE URI:http://js-schufa-rating-adapter.dxl-argocd/checkCreditStandingForCustomer WITH STATUS [200] ### {""state"":""SUCCESS"",""infotext"":[""X- KI SCOREBEREICH I"",""ES LIEGEN KEINE DATEN AUS OEFFENTLICHEN VERZEICHNISSEN ODER ZU VERTRAGSWIDRIGEM VERHALTEN VOR""],""fraudPreCheck"":{""resultType"":""VERARBEITUNGSFEHLER"",""errorMessage"":[""{id:PLA0012, text:Feld muss gefüllt sein, detail:GP-Geschaeftsvorgangsreferenz}""]},""schufaReferenceId"":""50273634""}

I don’t know which is the business logic for having externalCreditClass set to “X” but if it is not related to the schufa-rating response, I suggest to create a bug ticket and assign it to DXL for a deeper analysis from the development team.

Regards,
Raniero

Workaround can't be used-> when using existing/known IBANs, a different issue Error500 was faced, here is the new Bug for existing IBANs, Rohan and Eugen are working on it:

 # After the deployment of last Build (9.21.0-B51) in ACC2 & Build (9.21.10-B1) in ACC3 env’s we have observed that the *mono as services are starting at own* (2 services for each daemons). But, these changes are still in discussion (not yet approved from deployment & OPS side) and we have suggested some improvements and awaiting demo from Dev side.
 # We have observed that services are starting at own even after stopping and disabling. (observed on second server)
 # Due to above reasons in ACC3 we have used the old daemons config (which running as processes) and removed the values related to InfluxDB from config (changes related to Z_SRT02480101A: Remove InfluxDB Config from Mono Daemons). But, as per Marcin with old config atleast we need to configure InfluxDB host and port in config.

We had already aksed Marcin that Is that possible that the changes related to Z_SRT02480101A: Remove InfluxDB Config from Mono Daemons can be configured with old setup i.e., setup/config where mono daemons are running as processes till the time we will receive the new setup for daemons as service.;;;","26/Mar/25 1:01 PM;shubhangi.gholap@vodafone.com;Orders are moving Ahed and I10 & Fulfillment logs are getting generated

its a workaround. Please read my comment !!!;;;","26/Mar/25 9:24 PM;ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com;+*Summary from Meeting today*+

regarding point 1 mentioned in my comment yesterday:

*TID team* will setup a meeting with Dev team (Kevin & Deepika) to check on this & also in pipeline code to ensure only the changes related to Z_SRT02480101A should be configured with the old setup. (i.e. mono daemons running as process)

Regarding point 2: Dev team/Deepika will check on this in lower env.

Regarding point 3: 

*1{^}st{^} approach* – Configure the parameter *“<add key=""InfluxEnable"" value=""false""/>”* in ‘Credentials.config’ file and use the updated executables file for each daemon from new setup (i.e. from mono running as service)  -- not feasible option as it requires multiple manual changes.
*2{^}nd{^} approach –* We will setup a meeting with Dev team to check on this & also in pipeline code to ensure only the changes related to Z_SRT02480101A should be configured with the old setup.(i.e. mono daemons running as process) – current requirement as mentioned in point 1.

Other topics: 
Services are taking more than 5 mins (for single service) in restart, stop, or start. (part of new setup) -> Dev team/Deepika will check on this in lower env.

 # As checked and discussed, it looks like deployment pipeline have the code to setup the mono daemons as service from past only. And, when we deployed the new *mono daemons deployment* from Build (9.21.0-B51) in ACC2 & Build (9.21.10-B1) in ACC3 env’s the daemons started as service (2 services for each daemons) at own.

*AI* :- TechM team/Kevin will check in code part to disable the auto restart of these services. So, they will not restart at own after deployment for now.
 # Services are taking more than 5 mins (for single service) in restart, stop, or start. (part of new setup)

*AI* :- TechM team/Deepika will check on this in lower env.
 # The changes related to Z_SRT02480101A: Remove InfluxDB Config from Mono Daemons configuration with old setup i.e., setup/config where mono daemons are running as processes till the time we will receive the new setup for daemons as service.

*1/4 :* *1{^}st{^} approach* – Configure the parameter *“<add key=""InfluxEnable"" value=""false""/>”* in ‘Credentials.config’ file and use the updated executables file for each daemon from new setup (i.e. from mono running as service)  -- as suggested by Marcin
