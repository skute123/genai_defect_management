Hi [~ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com] [~natasa.dimovic1@vodafone.com] 

Based on further analysis it is identified that issue is also part of production build , not part of any recent delivery towards ACC and there is no clue that it was working before as well.

And there is no change on price calculations recently and so it takes time to identify the root cause, our primary suspect is that it can be PCAT issue.

Note: The problematic product is added by sales rule and if we add the product manually the price show correctly.;;;","18/Dec/24 1:53 PM;ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com;If you need any PCAT support for analysis just reach to them out directly and do a session to investigate;;;","20/Dec/24 12:52 PM;vikash.saurav@vodafone.com;As discussed with [~sandeepkumar.pradhan@vodafone.com] we will deliver in next available slot to Production on January based the delivery defect count as agreed VF.  ;;;","07/Jan/25 6:20 PM;atharva.paskanthi@vodafone.com;Hello Vikash Saurav, Vodafone (External), could you please check and update ETA for this ticket;;;","08/Jan/25 1:12 PM;vikash.saurav@vodafone.com;will deliver on 29.01 or post 9.1.2 minor release .what ever is earlier;;;","08/Jan/25 2:34 PM;ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com;on 29th of January there is no delivery to ACC1- production fixes are in freeze as on 5th of February ACC3 release is going live;;;","10/Jan/25 3:44 PM;vikash.saurav@vodafone.com;Sandeep Pradhan added a comment -

The MHV portal calls the Bundle Availability Service to correct GigaKombi products if both cable and mobile orders are in the basket.

We observed that the Bundle Availability Service is returning the wrong responses. Specifically, it does not return the All-In-One flatrates anymore (for example, FI3:AI1, FM5:AI1).

Well, Frederik stated:
 * There was no change on Cable side
 * There was no change on bundle side

I trust him concerning first point and I have same opinion on the second one.
I would suggest to ask the TechM guys for a more detailed logging of the bundle rule to check why it's working on ACC2 but not on ACC1.
[~natasa.dimovic1@vodafone.com] , [~anja.moellenbeck@vodafone.com]  could you please take care that TechM taking a look?

Thanks;;;","04/Dec/24 2:09 AM;frederik.finckh@vodafone.com;I am pretty sure the problem on acc1 vs acc2 is neither a cable nor a mobile pcat issue. See [my last comment on the PSTBUG ticket|https://de.jira.agile.vodafone.com/browse/PSTBUG-2798?focusedId=1164001&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels%3Acomment-tabpanel#comment-1164001].
BTW as there were hints about a broken cable rules artifact, I can not help but remark that the most likely reason why the correct product shows up in the contract summary is because the cable rules automatically correct the messed up selection in this case once they are actually executed.;;;","04/Dec/24 3:41 PM;anton.ustimenko@vodafone.com;Last comment from Frederick in PSTBUG:

When investigating this bug it only occured on the ACC1 and not the ACC2.
The cable posting rules are out of the question, as they are not even executed when clicking the gigakombi button.

We also checked the relevant input files on cable and mobile pcat side (Bundles.xml).
Diffing the involved cable products easily showed no significant changes.
The relevant bundle rule in this case is GK1a gigakombi bundle rule that has not changed in a very long time.
In particular I specifically checked exactly the imported version of the Bundles.xml.
This is why I wrote that this is an OSF issue.

Diving into OSFs backend shows that the problem is indeed not the input, but rather how it was processed and came out on the other side.

Bug was not reproducible on ACC2

but occured on ACC1

Hello [~natasa.dimovic1@vodafone.com] I have imported the acc1 pcat that you shared with Prod branch issue still exists

Hi [~vikash.saurav@vodafone.com] could you figure out why the colon is missing in BO? Thanks;;;","09/Dec/24 2:59 PM;frederik.finckh@vodafone.com;Hi [~natasa.dimovic1@vodafone.com] I am absolutely certain the issue of missing colons in the OSF backend is not caused by the cable pcat.
Therefore, I think that there is no need to compare the cable versions here.

I do suspect that the issue is the different version of OSF on acc1 vs acc2 as the Bundles.xml input looks fine.

The bundle rules are neither defined, nor processed from cable side.;;;","09/Dec/24 3:04 PM;natasa.dimovic1@vodafone.com;Thank you, [~frederik.finckh@vodafone.com]

Yes, your point is valid in case of Mobile and Cable stack orders. But for FN stack orders, InProgress-DocArchiving should be triggred after CUSTOMER_CREATED is received which is not happening now for ACC1 DSL orders.;;;","15/Nov/24 1:54 PM;alka.kshirsagar2@vodafone.com;DSL order status:

this is only for DSL, prod open a defect on this, Z_PRT00147947A.

the correct behavior is InProgress-DocArchiving sos is being called only after first attempt is empty.

i can see that we have the same build in ACC1 and ACC3.
seems in ACC3 we have an issue with the version of the flow:
!image-2024-11-17-09-09-04-404.png!

i will fix it manually in the env.
in next branch, 4000_WAVE9_PCK11_1, there will be version 36, so the issue will not be there;;;","18/Nov/24 1:03 PM;ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com;[~ran.farjun1@vodafone.com]  sorry I do not get your feedback.

The fix for Z_PRT00147947A is now present on ACC1 and since this time we are having the behavior described in this defect on ACC1.

(On Friday we deployed the same to ACC3 also)

So is it just an issue on ACC Environment now? Or what is the impact on prod, as fix for Z_PRT00147947A went live last week?

 ;;;","18/Nov/24 1:17 PM;ran.farjun1@vodafone.com;Hi Ari,

in ACC1 we have the fix and the behaviur is correct, order status will not change to InProgress-DocArchiving if the first response is not empty or invalid.
in ACC3 we have the same branch but deployment was with an error, the version of the flow that i mention, in that case OGW use older code and that code dosent have the fix;;;","18/Nov/24 1:22 PM;gokul.vade@vodafone.com;One more [~ran.farjun1@vodafone.com] 

if now Doc-archiving is only expected for empty response then what configuration changes you did on the environment ? 

Since it was already removed , i guess for DSL ;;;","18/Nov/24 1:57 PM;gokul.vade@vodafone.com;As discussed, we will retest it on ACc1 and ACC3 and will share the status ;;;","19/Nov/24 2:15 PM;maheedhar.bekkem@vodafone.com;Please find below observation of Archiving flow behavior in ACC1 and ACC3 environments.

As per the checkout flow. Delivery section was not offered when “Eigenhardware Kunde hardware “ HW product was opted.

if checkout (delivery section) and not shown and no data captured for Delivery then there is no delivery data send in SubmitOrder.

If the issue occurs again, it might be helpful to check the following two fields in the order tracking tool. 

!image-2024-11-11-18-55-34-893.png!

Both fields must be in state OK. If not, the completed event has not been posted. Multiple asynchronous processes are involved in the posting process of the order status. These asynchronous processes might take some time and have some internal recovery mechanism in case of problems. So it can happen that this process takes some time.

If the issue occures, I would propose to first check the ordertracking tool. If both fields mentioned before are in state Active, then I would suggest to wait a bit and see if the issue cures itself.;;;","11/Nov/24 6:59 PM;darshan.ramlingapa@vodafone.com;|904317|8461695|

We tried to investigate few orders which are stuck due to this issue .Below are the findings

1) Retry mechanism was working fine before changing the time for retry (from 2 hours to 10 min ). Major possibility is due to the config change done at runtime, its working unexpected.

2) We see Doc- achieving is triggered correctly but its not working after 1st count , as we can see its stuck at wait.

3) There are no changes done here except changing the timer.

4) To make sure this is not happenign in production, we can verify jesi_wf_flow_instance table if any flow on stand by for  vfde_telesales_doc_archiving_V41.xml

so this looks like this is env issue , and we will continue investigation as well.;;;","25/Oct/24 6:53 PM;ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com;We have changed the retry value back to 2 hours and are checking now if working as expected

i think this is because the new implementation of cr 604.
OGW is trying to call oneDms.
if there is an empty response then OGW will check the table: ogw_error_handler with this error: OGWERR-0099.
now it will try the numbers of times according to the value in the table: under max retry times.

in out case 24.
so first try it is not counting because it not retry, its the first time we calling the service.

TL;DR: outcome from cable analysis:
 * there was no difference in the static product configuration of the relevant products.
 * the cable product logic returns the products as visible for older and newer versions of the cable pcat
 * ideal next steps from our perspective:
 ** omnius developer should investigate why e{_}xactly{_} the products are not displayed

Hi [~natasa.dimovic1@vodafone.com] 

As we analyzed further with VF reporter and BA and identified that this is an expected behavior on OSE side. OSE will show Self Install → *Red* if we receive the node *selbstInstallationKz* with value {*}N{*}, *Green* when the *selbstInstallationKz* value on this node is *J.*

If on MAMAs response we have value J and OGW send the value as N on OIL. Then this has to be checked with OGW why we have wrong mapping on OGW.

We have scheduled a call with Kai and Testing team to troubleshoot this issue further.
1. During call itself we have check the database connectivity for PRGFVDB using the telnet for both Port (1627 and 1723).
2. Currently telnet is working with Port 1723 which is not in use for the database connection[PFA mail for reference].
3. As of now we are checking to establish the database connectivity with Port 1627 for PRGVFDB on PR DMS server.

We have compared GVF_DB config file in both IT and PR new DMS servers and found that multiple details are missing in IT new DMS GVF_DB config file.
 
Please find below details for GVF_DB config file from IT and PR environment.
 
PR new DMS GVF_DB config file:

Driver=""Oracle in OraClient19Home1""

As per our understanding these configurations must be done while doing the setup for respective servers.
 
We have asked kai to suggest whether this config changes are required then accordingly we can raise CCR ticket with deployment team to configure the missing details in IT GVF_DB config file.

DB Size
Observed that ITROMDB is significantly larger than PRROMDB. Despite the size difference,there is no noticeable impact on performance.

DB Configuration
Compared the configurations, both databases have identical configurations, including software versions and patches.

SGA (System Global Area) 
Compared SGA components such as shared pool, buffer cache, and redo log buffer, including their sizes and configurations. All components are  same in both database.

Gather Stats Status for Specific Tables
Checked statistics gathering status for tables OM_REPORTING_IN, OM_REQUEST,EA_REQUEST,OM_REQUEST,OM_ORDER,OMS_RENDERRESULT,OM_REPORTING_OUT and OM_ORDER. Include details on when stats were last gathered and their current status. All table stats are up to date and no table found in stale_stats status

Check for Abnormalities in ITROM Database
Identify any abnormalities in the ITROM database, such as performance issues, error logs and unusual behavior.-->In progress, ADBA Team will provide details soon. ADBA team will highlight if any abnormalities found

 

Analyze AWR Report
Provide a brief summary of the AWR report, including the time period covered and any significant findings-->In progress, ADBA Team will provide details.

Hi Natasa ,

From the error message mentioned above it is clear that some of the backend connectivity between OGW and actual backend is timeout or may be between systems which comes after OGW facing some timeout issues. This has to be verified by the actual backend system where we received the above error.

HI [~nasir.sayyad@vodafone.com] 

Based on further discussion with VF and @Sarabjeet it is identified that the serviceability we do manually via serviceability bar goes in 2 step 1 validate address happens based on response we received we trigger the CheckServicibality with complete address details.

But in case of convert lead we depend on address details received as part of search lead response and these details are not complete in the above case, which resulted in different CheckServicibality response. And on this case cable and cable tv were not available to service.

We have checked and compare both response for Cable and DSL where we cannot see any different for Response. And yes it is working for DSL lead.

Hi [~nasir.sayyad@vodafone.com] ,

As we discussed the lead search response we get address details to trigger the CheckServiceibility and it may be possible to get search response with same address. Then OSE will use the address received on lead search response. In this case we trigger the check serviceability using the same address for both DSL or Cable covert lead and serviceability response is same in both cases. But that response allow change to DSL lead only and not Cable. Because Cable availability is false for the address we triggered check serviceibility.

We need someone with product catalog functional knowledge and Bundle Logic knowledge to explain why this test case is marked as failure?

My analysis: Analysis is done for test case ""US 893 Service Address in GigaKombi Request DSL ILSBLU existingCustomerTN + Mobile ACQ GigaKombi ACQ Mobile ILS Fixed ILS Fixed"". At the end of the comment is the request to the API and response of the API. The request contains one mobile and 2 fixed offer containers and API is responding back with below data:
 * ""GigaKombi"" bundle is possible between container 1 and 2: {color:#00875a}This looks functionally correct.{color}
 * SKUs KGKRED6UL, KVFAIO2MRK, KVFGSAIOHKaDV_8_4034 is to be added on Mobile offer container. {color:#00875a}This looks functionally correct.{color}
 * SKUs V0987TO and GS_R1_VoiceOption_9_99E[br]EOL is to be added on the fixed offer container. {color:#00875a}This looks functionally correct.{color}
 * No SKU to be removed. {color:#00875a}This looks functionally correct.{color}

From my analysis everything looks okay functionally in the API response and the test case should be passed, So we need someone with functional understanding of catalog and bundling rule to explain why this specific test case is marked as failure in Vodafone testing. Once we have this information we can analyze other failing test cases.

 

Unfortunately, till someone from Vodafone explains why the test case is marked as failure, I am unable to provide a resolution for this.

As per your finding, this is not a defect. working as per design.

Basically, for that use case not shown the warning is basically there is something change for tv package which is not visible to UI. but on system level these are stored.

According to SubmitOrder request logs. there is product sku (WESTATUSSI) added for TV package in shopping cart. which allow to submit the order. Refer the CommercialDetails node. 
And not visible in Orderline/Component level. May be due to PCAT multimapper.

Basically this sku is hidden product as per PCAT configuration (product visibility).

So this looks to me not an issue from Omnius side as per Omnius sol. where as Omnius sol found there is a change in Cable tv package. means product sku (WESTATUSSI) is added.

This must be further investigate from VF PCAT team.;;;","28/Oct/24 3:13 PM;natasa.dimovic1@vodafone.com;Thank you [~vikash.saurav@vodafone.com]! I talked to Simon and the bug can be rejected – >

we have discussed this defect together with Gaurab from Amdocs in one of the sessions, last week, in which we analysed E2E the expected behaviour and discussed some defects.

Also Waldemar and Michael Heller were involved.

 

1. What I miss in this error description is the EXACT activities, that the agent/tester has done.

my assumption is:  the agent has selected the unsharp sim swap (which is a possibility in Retail, that will disappear with the esim Push Epic, but is still available if the permission for insert sim_serial_number is set (I think)

so..  question:  did indeed the tester select the UNSHARP SIMSWAP?

 

Because:

IF Agent selects UNSHARP SIMSWAP, 

THEN SubmitOrder.SIMCARD = E (as it always was)

and... OGW is triggered to send the emails when SIMCARD =E

(so.. this is not correct)

 

AS AGREED WITH GAURAB :

Amdocs will change/improve the software:

OGW will not only check for SIMCARD = E,  but will also check whether the NEW_SIM_SERIAL_NUMBER is not populated.

only then the emails will be sent;;;","30/Dec/24 3:46 PM;ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com;[~akash.ubbu@vodafone.com]  [~ajay.bhavar@vodafone.com]  [~elena.fueger@vodafone.com]  can you comment on the question from Rob?

-> did indeed the tester select the UNSHARP SIMSWAP?

 

(set to ""in progress"" again - as per comment amdocs is working on a fix);;;","30/Dec/24 5:25 PM;ajay.yashwantbhavar@vodafone.com;-> did indeed the tester select the UNSHARP SIMSWAP?

Hello [~robert.goebbels@vodafone.com] In both cases, Email is getting triggered, As the parameter SIMSWAP reason is always handed over to OGW with the value VR (Unsharp) even if the agent has selected Sharp (VS) in front end.

Please find below screenshot from submit order request.

Summary: 
 * works as (wrongly) designed
 * Amdocs will fix this without the need of a Change Request
 ** OGW will not only check:  is SIMTYPE E, in order to trigger the emails, BUT also check if the SIMNumber is empty

 

Details:

RETAIL channel; blocking permissions set:
 * agent must therefore insert SIM number (instead of SIMTYPE) AND
 * agent has possiblity to select Sharp vs unsharp simswap 

Omnius sends in submit Order
 * SIMYPE E, because agent has selected unsharp SIMSWAP (not clear to me, but it looks like Omnius also sends SIMTYPE E, if the agent selected sharp SIMSWAP, if I understand the comments right). 
 * SIMSERIAL number (because Agent has inserted a (physical) SIMnumber 

OGW triggers 5910 and/or 5930 email although the agent has inserted a (physical)  sim number

 

Solution: Even if Omnius sends SIMTYPE E,  OGW must also check, if a SIMNumber is provided  in submitOrder.  if the simnumber is empty, only then trigger the emails 

-->  as aligned with Gaurab some weeks ago

on those addresses are ""Anzahl der Wohneinheiten"" (Number of residential units) = 0 and the object is still not ""erschlossen"" (""developed"") therefore Wizard refuses the creation of customers on those addresses.

This is very unlikely that in production someone is placing the order on those addresses. Even if this is the case then the agent can change this manually in the wizard.

After the object will be developed then update should come from Delphi probably (If you want you can contact Delphi people for detailed clarification of the process).

In the nutshell - such addresses shouldn't be taken for test -> I will address this issue to our collegues maintainig address search in QA tools in the order to exclude such object from search results to avoid missunderstandings in the feature.

i saw it, but like Affan has mention, there is no change in OGW behavior. we dont have a condition to check this.
is this something new that OGW need to check?

if yes we need to raise it to business to be aware of the change and what is the consequences. ;;;","07/Oct/24 7:12 PM;darshan.ramlingapa@vodafone.com;Hi [~ran.farjun1@vodafone.com]

we are not sending *MobileContract*  to OM because there is a condition
if belated proting dont send *MobileContract* .
its from the defect  OS-26925 that was mention by Darshan.
regarding *MobileContractBusiness,* there are 2 conditions: SOHOBUS;MOB_TC
this case is MOB_TC (mobTariffChange), that's why we are sending *MobileContractBusiness*;;;","07/Oct/24 10:35 PM;ajay.yashwantbhavar@vodafone.com;Hello [~ran.farjun1@vodafone.com] 

As per analysis from OM side, MobileContractBusiness document is not required for Mobile standalone porting as they checked same scenario with removing this document name from send document request and it's working fine (PFA Email).

SOHOBUS;MOB_TC seems this condition is only applicable when usecase indication is ILSMOBCHG but without Porting.

I see only MobilePorting and MobileBew documents are required for Standalone Belated Porting in Retail channel.

Can you please check again from your side 😊;;;","07/Oct/24 10:49 PM;ran.farjun1@vodafone.com;Hi Ajay,

like i said before, we dont have this condition, when usecase indication is ILSMOBCHG and in this order MOB_TC is valid we will send MobileContractBusiness to OM.

But in the RetreiveCustomerInfo - Mode2 this information is missing. It should be mentioned under AttributeValue. This is the reason why it is failing.

Hello Atish,

 

As per discussion in troubleshooting call with LIG team, They  found out that SBUS now sends a Client Certificate to LIG. Usually LIG is expecting a Basic Authentication.

 

We checked from IT SBUS side and we did not see any issue from Configuration and SSL certificates.

 

Also all the installed SSL certificates related to SBUS and LIG are valid and the config files for LIG services are not changed.

 

Kindly raise SPN against SBUS dev team. PFA SBUS and OPM logs.

Hi [~natasa.dimovic1@vodafone.com] 

the error message says: “{*}Delivery address data failure: The specified delivery address requires DHL identification{*}“. As far as I understand, it expects DHL Identification under DeliveryList section. In OGW DeliveryDetails logs we can see:

!image-2024-10-01-14-03-29-683.png!

Lets take a look at the ContactList for the same:

!image-2024-10-01-14-04-09-185.png!

There is a DHLIdentification here. So, the delivery details have this DHLIdentification under ContactList. 

hi [~ran.farjun1@vodafone.com]  can you please check and clarify  this defect   where do OGW expect to see this DHLIdentification?;;;","01/Oct/24 3:53 PM;ran.farjun1@vodafone.com;Hi,

per our understanding, when we have 1 customer we need to have 1 set of addresses in the submit request that the type of the are not repeating.
in this case we can see 1 customer and double set of addresses for each type:
  <Type>S</Type>, <Type>PA</Type>, <Type>DL</Type>, <Type>L</Type>
for *DHL identification* we are taking more data from: address type DL.
and in the second occurrence of it a crucial data is missing.
there is no delivery location data.
can you please check?;;;","01/Oct/24 4:06 PM;natasa.dimovic1@vodafone.com;Hi [~vikash.saurav@vodafone.com] could you please check the latest comment of [~ran.farjun1@vodafone.com]? Thank you;;;","01/Oct/24 8:11 PM;vikash.saurav@vodafone.com;Irina added a comment 
 
 
Hi [~ran.farjun1@vodafone.com] / [~natasa.dimovic1@vodafone.com] 
In this ProcessOrder Request we have one Customer but two Logical packages. As per design we transfer all Addresses for all Logical packages that have nonempty Street name.

So, my question i is the count of Logical packages, correct?;;;","03/Oct/24 3:29 PM;atharva.paskanthi@vodafone.com;As discussed in call scheduled today,

- Elango & Tanvi triggered the UM and Cable flow respectively again to check
- The issue is still reproducible and orders failed with same error
- Upon checking Archive logs, Irina suggested that there are 2 Logical packages in Request

 ;;;","03/Oct/24 5:38 PM;affan.baragazi@vodafone.com;Hi, 
1) For OGW addresses are affiliated with customer. Logically same customer is having multiple addresses so as the address details for same address type are not same resulting addresses being overwritten!
2) To answer your question , one customer can have two orderlines but not different address for same address type as per design at OGW.
Thanks ;;;","05/Oct/24 4:49 PM;ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com;[~atharva.paskanthi@vodafone.com]  is it correct that ticket is now assigned to TechM? What are the next steps?;;;","07/Oct/24 1:05 PM;atharva.paskanthi@vodafone.com;Hi [~ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com], Yes as per Amdocs 2 different address for same address type should not be there, Therefore TechM needs to investigate further.
If required we'll schedule a call with both of them, once TechM provides their inputs

[~natasa.dimovic1@vodafone.com] 

 this topic needs to discuss with VF design team,

For me this is not a defect.

Basically in mobile package usecase SubmitOrder xml. AddressDetails node pointing to SubscriberDetail node. So it can easily identifying the pointer for AddressDetail node to OrderlineDetail.

Where in cable/dsl usecase, there is no subscriber then how it was done in past to identifying AddressDetail node to OrderlineDetail.

And there was an agreement that regardless of if order contains single or multiple cable package the AddressDetails must pointing to CustomerDetail node. where these address can or can’t identical. this behavior is since wave1

Whereas Delivery Details node point to Address Details seq. and this looks to me working as per design.;;;","10/Oct/24 4:18 PM;natasa.dimovic1@vodafone.com;Hi [~vikash.saurav@vodafone.com] if it is not a defect, why it is allowed to select a packing station in the frontend? Thank you;;;","10/Oct/24 4:33 PM;ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com;[~vikash.saurav@vodafone.com]  As mentioned it worked before

See [OS-6780] OSF | Wave 6.0 | ACC2 | DHL shop pickup locations are not visible on UME adresses - Vodafone Global Jira

Expected: DHL shop pickup locations are visible for UME addresses

 

Only shops should not be available. 

 

I do not get the discussion with multiple adress data and ""2 Logical packages in Request"" -> as per description its new customer with just KIP package, so regular use case. 
Why is it having repeating adress data in submit request as per Ran? ;;;","10/Oct/24 6:23 PM;gaurav.lanjewar1@vodafone.com;As Discussed in the call,

as we talked this is not a defect on OGW.
can you mention information regarding this issue?;;;","03/Oct/24 12:46 PM;ajay.yashwantbhavar@vodafone.com;Schedule call with VF BA to discuss this issue.;;;","04/Oct/24 3:59 PM;ajay.yashwantbhavar@vodafone.com;Send mail to Business Team: [~andrea.allmenroeder@vodafone.com] [~janine.hesshaus@vodafone.com] [~jan.beuss1@vodafone.com] for their confirmation on this functionality.

We have identified Prolongation issue in Wave9.1 Acceptance Test for Skeleton Business customers where OGW is calling “CustomerDocument:ContractLetterRequest” call towards KIAS but KIAS is not accepting this call and returning following error back to OGW -> Request not allowed for Subscriber under skeleton BAN, Due to this issue order are getting stuck in OGW and OGW opening SKY ticket for same order. Can you please check from Business side that Is this “ContractLetter” Required for Skeleton BAN?
If Yes -> KIAS needs to accept this request.If No -> OGW needs to remove this call for Skeleton customers. 

Please find below JIRA ticket for Reference (Request and Response logs are present in ticket).

Seems we need to discuss on this topic as PackageID is mandatory to show correct status in front end for package level.

Reference story: [OS-5595] OGW: As a system i want to enrich the metadata of the contract summary in OneDMS in the telesales channel - Vodafone Global Jira

[~daniel.loos@vodafone.com] [~ran.farjun1@vodafone.com] We can discuss this issue over a call tomorrow.;;;","07/Oct/24 9:52 PM;ran.farjun1@vodafone.com;Hi [~ajay.yashwantbhavar@vodafone.com] ,

not sure how OS-5595 US is connected to push order status and PackageID;;;","07/Oct/24 10:17 PM;ajay.yashwantbhavar@vodafone.com;Hello [~ran.farjun1@vodafone.com] 

Mentioned User story is just reference for DocArchiving status, May be we can check according when OGW set DocArchiving status as order line status which parameters OGW should send to Omnius.

As package Id is Mandatory field for updating package level status in Omnius, Can you please check from OGW side, Is this code issue for solstice stack as for other stacks this functionality is working fine and correct status is shown on front end.;;;","07/Oct/24 10:43 PM;ran.farjun1@vodafone.com;from the code i can see the problem is that order line is empty, you can see it in push order status as well.
the doc archiving in solstice is not getting trigger like the other stacks from set order status.
thats the different and that is way we cant se the PackageID.

but seems this was always like this;;;","08/Oct/24 12:12 PM;daniel.loos@vodafone.com;I can see that the example in this Solstice US also has the logicalPackageID populated:
https://jira.sp.vodafone.com/browse/OS-34263
This might very well be a defect that exists for a long time as ILS never worked and ACQ is automatically closed off without status handling in the MVP solution that was tested in ACQ.
Please also align with Oren.;;;","08/Oct/24 2:45 PM;ran.farjun1@vodafone.com;currently i fix this issue, now in push order status we will se order line and logicalPackageID ;;;","09/Oct/24 8:31 PM;deepak.garg1@vodafone.com;Fixed in CN_18815;;;","10/Oct/24 6:56 PM;tanvi.bagade@vodafone.com;Hi all, issue is now resolved & correct status is updated at order level & product level. Therefore closing the ticket

As per finding,

there is an US related to CR562. VFDED1FTS-3562 identified to say VVL is allow for dunning customer in Omnius.

So, if customer is in Dunning then Omnius has allow to perform VVL for his Ibase regardless to Customer type.

This look to also for SOHO RV BUSINESS. as it is not allow because his existing contract not exceed from 18 month. which is also fine.

Therefore this is not a defect. working as expected design CR562;;;","01/Oct/24 4:05 PM;ajay.yashwantbhavar@vodafone.com;Thank you [~vikash.saurav@vodafone.com] for confirmation :);;;",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

""Team Ash would have a look but first in the next week CW41."" does not contain any delivery date, just an information when team Ash will have a look into the issue.

Also [~satish.dhere1@vodafone.com]  was asking for further information in his last comments to get further infromation about progress status and delivery date.

Best regards;;;","08/Oct/24 8:29 PM;simon.auch@vodafone.com;I took a look from cable side, the implementation for this rule has not changed since it was implemented.
The rule looks like follows:
{code:java}
- identifier: ""informAboutFtthAvailability""
  description: ""Display a message to inform the agent that they should talk to the customer about the FTTH availability""
  condition: ""availability.HasTechnology(null, 1, 'FTTH-L2-BSA', 'GRUEN,GRUEN_GRAU,GELB', '(ACCESS_SUPPLIER;OXC)')""
  title: ""WICHTIGER Buchungshinweis - OXG Glasfaserverfügbarkeit""
  text: ""An dieser Adresse bitte auf FTTH beraten! Für DSL/KIP gilt: Downgrades nur für Wechselgarantie, Upgrades nur auf FTTH erlaubt. Neukunde nur mit max. BB 50 erlaubt.""
  processContext: [ ""ILSBLU"", ""MIGCOC"", ""MOVE"", ""ACQ"" ]
  packageType: ""CABLE_INTERNET_PHONE""
  portals: [ ""OFT"", ""HA"" ] {code}
Relevant place in the repository: https://github.vodafone.com/VFDE-Portals/ProductSetup/blob/main/input/omniusData/Cable_Messages.yaml#L302

The condition was provided to us by [~marco.abraham01@vodafone.com] during the discussion of the implementation quite some time ago in this comment: [https://jira.sp.vodafone.com/browse/OS-51716?focusedId=3110733&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels:comment-tabpanel#comment-3110733]

My assumption would be that there is a mistake in the condition (given that back when it was implemented it could only be tested with a mock I believe). Since these conditions and the entire expression language is developed by OSF, and we also have no way of knowing what the correct values for the `HasTechnology` check are: can someone from OSF provide us with the correct condition?
Or maybe [~marco.abraham01@vodafone.com]  could you check what the current implementation on DSL side for the corresponding rule is?;;;","08/Oct/24 8:42 PM;simon.auch@vodafone.com;So according to OSF when the address from the ticket is loaded the access supplier for the address is not ""OXC"" but ""OXGG"", can someone (from OSF/DSL/Business) whether or not the condition should check for ""ACCESS_SUPPLIER;OXGG"" instead of OXC (or either of these two)?

[~marco.abraham01@vodafone.com], [~metin.celik@vodafone.com] since you where both involved in the solution design, are you aware of any changes to this condition?

 ;;;","09/Oct/24 12:32 PM;simon.auch@vodafone.com;I got a reply from [~marco.abraham01@vodafone.com], it apparently should be OXGG and not OXC as supplier.

as per following user story I can see this remark:

[OS-50478] OMNIUS_Serviceability: As Omnius I should be able to display relevant attributes for FTTH OXG availability in the detailed information of serviceability so that agent can book the FTTH OXG product(OS-50478) - Vodafone Global Jira

Sales_Phase Display:When Checkserviceability response contains ""Sales_Phase"" value for FTTH-L2-BSA/OXG then Omnius displays received ""Sales_Phase"" value (e.g., ""Vorvermarktung"", ""Nachverdichtung"", ""Regelvermarktung"").

CheckServiceability/Reference_Serviceability contains the presales and Redensifcation phases 

Checkserviceability response contains Sales_Phase value the same must be displayed as received, If the node is not received Omnius must display the field at all
*Example:*
*Vermarktungsphase* 

                   *Vorvermarktung*

                   *Nachverdichtung*

                   *Regelvermarktung*
Not sure if this is of any help though.
Maybe [~philipp.roeper1@vodafone.com]  you can crosscheck;;;","13/Oct/24 11:37 AM;natasa.dimovic1@vodafone.com;Hi [~ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com], hi [~simon.auch@vodafone.com], not sure if it should be the same requirement for DSL and Cable, but on DSL side the message box should only be shown for Regelvermarktung (GREEN) and Nachverdichtung (ORANGE). [~shuyan.luo@vodafone.com] please correct me if I'm wrong. Thanks

@natasa, yes, you are right. For DSL, we should only pop up the sales-hint for standard-marketing and redentification, NEVER for pre-marketing.

;;;","13/Oct/24 6:12 PM;lukas.haes1@vodafone.com;Hi [~simon.auch@vodafone.com] 
Die Salesphase ist der Ausbaustatus der Leitung, also ist sie in Betrieb oder wird sie geplant bzw. in naher Zukunft gebaut:
- Regelvermarktung/Standard Sales: GRUEN
- Vorvermarktung/Presales: GELB_GRAU
- Nachverdichtung/Redensification: ORANGE

 

Die Gesamte-Logik wie die VFP interpretiert wird sollte sich meines Wissens nach nicht von DGW oder DTAG unterscheiden. Der unterschied bei OXG ist das eben die Warning Messages angezeigt werden sollen.

 

Sorry it is sunday, I forgot to write in english

@Lukas,
OXG would have some special characters differs from other fiber carriers. Yes, they would have the same product portfolio, but it has few marketing restrictions, for example for those Overbuild cases (in German: Überbaugebiet), for those business details, you guys could ask Niklas Mausberg for details.

;;;","14/Oct/24 3:35 PM;simon.auch@vodafone.com;So my assumption right now is that the condition is simply missing `ORANGE` (as mentioned by some answers in this comment section) and should be:
{code:java}
availability.HasTechnology(null, 1, 'FTTH-L2-BSA', 'GRUEN,GRUEN_GRAU,GELB,ORANGE', '(ACCESS_SUPPLIER;OXGG)')  {code}

 ;;;","17/Oct/24 6:19 PM;simon.auch@vodafone.com;As I wrote before, from cable perspective we only provide the rule without having any way of analysing what the issue with OSF based rules are/could be.
Either an omnius developer shares up to date documentation with us regarding these rules, conditions, and how to debug them or an omnius developer will have to analyse why the rule doesn't work.

Aside from looking at the rule and checking for typos we do not really have any insight into their execution.

Hi [~satish.dhere1@vodafone.com] 

Based on further analysis I have observed that there is no issue with the PCAT sale rule which is mentioned below, but there seems to be some issue with priority of the access technology '{{{}FTTH-L2-BSA{}}}' we pass in the rule input. If I change the serviceability stub for redensification address with priority from 2 to 1 for the node having access technology as {{FTTH-L2-BSA}} with downstream of 1000000, then we are getting the model window with expected warning message.

!image-2024-10-24-18-28-24-192.png!

as OSE is working as expected based on serviceability response received and the rule imported.

Either PCAT team can add new rule by changing {{service_source_expression}} of the rule by passing priority as 2 like, {{availability.HasTechnology(null, 2, 'FTTH-L2-BSA', 'GRUEN,GRUEN_GRAU,GELB,ORANGE', '(ACCESS_SUPPLIER;OXGG)')""}}

Or can be checked on serviceability response on why for the access technology ‘{{{}FTTH-L2-BSA{}}}' we don’t have priority 1

The order mentioned here was created 2 months ago on August 2nd on test4b/VT4 and not processed until September 27th.

test2b is connected to GIT. That is the reason why the customer cannot be found there.

If the connections from OSF (ACC1-3) to Portals (test1b-4b) were changed between creation and processing of the order, this could also be a reason.

 * after ACC2 was connected to test4b, somehow cable started to send status updates as Test4b was in use again

Dear Cable Team,

Since past releases, we are observing that when we switch the OSF Cable backend Connections (e.g., Test 4b Test2b) somehow after certain period of time Cable env is triggering unexpected SetOrderStatus for the unfinished backend Orders.
E.g.:
•	initial order came from ACC1 when connected to test4b
•	then we moved with ACC1 to test2b before all orders got status updates
•	No ACC environment was connected to test4b until mid of last week
•	after ACC2 was connected to test4b, somehow cable started to send status updates as Test4b was in use again
•	status reached ACC1, but there is now a mismatch because its now connected to test2b and cannot update a customer ID for test4b related to setmarketingpermissions
So, we wanted to ask for some below possible solution from your side to avoid sending this not completed SetOrderCalls towards OSF –as due to this we are generating 100s of SKY tickets.
1.	Whenever we switch from OSF to connect different Cable system—Can we identify the not completed orders from OSF which has reached Cable
2.	If we identify(from point 1) then can we somehow manually complete the order or Stop this SetOrderStatus Process for these orders 
Please let us know if you need some information from our side to identify some old data—like we can provide you the range of OSF orders from the Env and then you can check on your end with unified order id field or something similar reference tracking data.

I’ll take this point to discussion in the portals solution and will come back to you.


--So As of now it seems we have an expected behavior from cable where SetOrderStatus call would be triggered unexpectedly for the unfinished orders.
We can conclude and close this defect;;;","09/Oct/24 1:21 PM;taher.golvala@vodafone.com;Thank you for the confirmation Rohan. We are closing the defect;;;",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

 after implement the new US (OS-40463) OGW can get ORDER_COMPLETED from DSL even before doc archiving is finished.

In this case: OS-62529, fast search response is empty, so OGW will wait and try again up to 24 times. Meanwhile DSL is sending us ORDER_COMPLETED status.

So now OGW is sending push Order status to Omnius that order is completed success even though the doc archiving is not yet finished.

Before the implementation of this US (OS-40463) doc_archiving was trigger once ORDER_COMPLETED was receive from DSL, so once doc_archiving was finished only then push order status with completed success was trigger.

latest update from Oren Aharoni, the designer:

Oren Aharoni]-  this is design gap and has to be discussed and agree with business,
 * In OS-40463 it was requested to trigger OneDMS call once InProgress FulfillmentStarted received  
 * Later we were requested  to trigger OneDMS after CUSTOMER_CREATED  status provided (attached)
 * Since the time between CUSTOMER_CREATED  to ORDER_COMPLETED  might be short above scenario might happen,

In order to resolve it we can keep dependency between OGW status Completed Success (Order completed)  as prerequisite to trigger OneDMS

This is design change and need VF to agree to new approach.

the issue is the OGW is not triggering the Fast Search
current logic  Fast Search will get trigger when OGW will receive status CUSTOMER_CREATED from DSL.
ACC1: status receive from DSL: ORDER_RECEIVED

ACC2: tatus receive from DSL: ORDER_COMPLETED, ORDER_RECEIVED *5.

so for all this cases Fast search will not be trigger;;;","26/Sep/24 7:04 PM;ran.farjun1@vodafone.com;mail chain was started regarding this issue:

after the call this is the solution that were agreed:
OGW will call doc_archiving when these 3 conditions are meet:

We are performing GUI testing for ACC3, so basically all retrieve customers are triggering OGW services in backend.
As we had agreed long ago, I had attached the respected test data (customer) and login Id (correlation id) along with the Kibana monitoring service logs for your reference.
I believe you can easily find the OGW services which are taking time once you with go through the logs attached. 
For you reference I have also sent you Catalina logs through H2H file transfer.;;;","30/Sep/24 1:02 PM;ran.farjun1@vodafone.com;In this defect , it's not specified from OGW POV where is the delay exactly .
e.g we have seen that correlation id being used for 3 OGW services
1) Legacysearch 
2) GetCustomerDetails
3) GetProductAvailability
To investigate anything further we will exact OGW service details which is causing delay.
Also we tried to analyse <CorrelationID>1clpme6urq144am5p9pl83q0ki</CorrelationID> where VFDEGetCustomerDetails  is getting called twice .

 

Please share valid data to investigate further with more detailed details of OGW service;;;","30/Sep/24 1:19 PM;gagan.patkar@vodafone.com;!screenshot-1.png|thumbnail!

hi [~natasa.dimovic1@vodafone.com] 
 As per the analysis we can see in mode2 first subscription has missing with Tariff component details. so as a result application is not able to identify the open order logic for the change package button. Kindly check the customer data issue with appropriate back end team.

As we checked further for the problematic DSL customer there is no open order on Install Base or on the OSE as a result OSE application is not restricting the change package for the package. Kindly verify

Hi [~natasa.dimovic1@vodafone.com] 

OSE don't treat order with status like ‘OrderCompletedWithCancellation', 'OrderCompletedWithFailure', 'OrderCompletedSuccessfuly' and also other logic related to order packages status etc as open orders. This is very old implementation I didn’t find specific reference regarding open order logic on OSE for the same if still we need to details can be discussed with BA.;;;","17/Oct/24 12:19 PM;natasa.dimovic1@vodafone.com;Hi [~vikash.saurav@vodafone.com], thank you!

Hi All,
 
Had a joint call with VF testing team and @SunilkumarCM

The expectation was to show a warning pop-up message in the configurator when DSL/KIP packages are selected.

This was not covered in Omnius development - The Configurator warning pop-up messages are driven by PCAT rulings

As part of Omnius change for warning message was only part of the Serviceability bar and not the configurator;;;","26/Sep/24 9:32 PM;shuyan.luo@vodafone.com;Hi guys,

I wonder, that you did not get it, since [~natasa.dimovic1@vodafone.com] did also some pcat-test on ACC1, and she got this warning-box on ACC1...

Then only this message box appears: ;;;","01/Oct/24 12:36 PM;satish.dhere1@vodafone.com;Comment from Shuyan:



For now, for the warning message only, we would update the ticket oref-603, so in case both Cable and OXG are available on one address, and EVEN IF Cable has higher priority than OXG, we should throw the ""Buchungshinweis für OXG"", not the one for Cable.

Later for Feb., there would be a new change request (OREF-??), at then we would NOT ONLY throw the warning message, we would also change the logic of product-offers on configurator, so only those products/tarifs would be appeared on configuratior, which are allowed

*Workaround:*

+KIP:+ 
 * depending on the hardware, mostly HO1:000 (Homespot: minimum contract duration: 0 months) is booked automatically and cannot be deselected – > select the own hardware ""[AON] Eigener Kabel-Router vorhanden"" under options (this option has also 0 months, but this is ignored, because it's the own hardware of the customer)

+TV:+
 * for KAD there is no workaround. There are always options booked automatically with a minimum contract duration of 0 months (like DV2:T02, DV2:000, HDC:000) and they cannot be deselected
 * book KAA only (TV Connect)

+KUD:+ 
 * for all GigaTV Appy there is no workaround. The option ""ACP:T02"" is booked automatically with a minimum contract duration of 0 months

 # Login to Telesale/Retail channel

 * click on ""Paket hinzufügen >> DSL & Glasfaser Produkte""

Initially all stack orders are stuck in SPP state - later we have observed that initial OM delivery was not deployed correctly on IT env.

OC.000160873  ROM-49.01.00.04

Expected version:  *440.06.09*

Current version: 440.06.00
After redeployment of the OC  Mobile CS started working .

but Cabel and DSL are still stuck in SPP/initial state - Later after having discusison with Yesil hatice , we have identified below error in OM log and OM Team identified it is an issue and need to be FIX .

Hi [~atharva.paskanthi@vodafone.com]

3) check payment section page

4) weiter button will be disabled

 

Actual result:

Currently we are blocked on Payment section page as weiter button is disabled and an error message is shown

Expected result:

We have identified a new gap in ESIMPush epic, at least for me it looks like a solution gap.

Following are the scenarios :
 # ShiptoStore
 # Telesales/Retail
 # VORAS sending us status [VORAS_FINAL_SUCCESS_SHIP_TO_STORE_HANDOUT] in StOrderStatus (after H/W is handed out), with OmniusOrderID as OGWSubOrderId .

 

Expectation and issue:

 
 # OGW will identify the OGWOrderID using the OmniusOrderID and then subsequently the Subcriber Information to perform the ESIMPush procedure [ GeteSIMInfo + MaintainEID] .
 # Currently this is failing as in the request we don’t have OrderLineID , hence OGW doesn’t know which OrderLine to pick for subscriber information [it will be trickier if more than one OrerLineID associated with the order] to fetch the Subscriber Info to progress further.

 

Please note: VORAS doesn’t have OrderLineID in talesales scenario.

 

We need to discuss together to close the gap.

Still analysis is going on : [~anton.ustimenko@vodafone.com] ;;;","22/Oct/24 2:39 PM;anton.ustimenko@vodafone.com;Team Neptune analysed the issue in more detail in [https://de.jira.agile.vodafone.com/browse/CATNEPTUNE-1075]. 

We found that Wizard apparently stores a list of admitted titles in a view called wiz_name_titles, composed of the entries in C_NAME_TITLE_A and 
C_NAME_TITLE_B. Trying the OSF order procedure with various OSF titles that were not present in the Wizard table (from the drop down menu there), we could reproduce the error, e.g., for Dipl.-Ing (BA), Dipl.-Volkswirt and for Dipl.-Ing.oec., while we confirmed for some titles in the table that they are working (see also the examples given above). 

*A solution on OSF side would therefore be to change the GUI as such to only accept values given in Wizard's prod C_NAME_TITLE_A and* 
*C_NAME_TITLE_B tables.* 

Further downstream, we analysed the handling of the field containing the ""title"" through various stages (VKD Gateway, IBP, AWOP and CVGAPI adapter). CVGAPI is used by OrderSearch, which logs the following:

We see that the order retrieval as such was successful, but that the order is corrupted. Even before, the AWOP_ERROR flag got added; this happens if AWOP finds error messages logged  by AWOP if there was an error beforehand by analysing it with the hasErrors() method.

We are therefore quite sure that the error happens in the processing between OSF and AWOP, i.e., probably in VKDGateway and IBP. Unfortunaltely, we could not find any filtering mechanism or validation thatid responsible for throwing the error. From VKD side, adding the UME fields might help, but it is hard to say if this really helps because of the high compplexity of what happens in between. Probably, the easiest would be the solution suggested above: Forbid the OSF GUI users to choose values not supported by the Wizard tables C_NAME_TITLE_A and C_NAME_TITLE_B by deleting these values from the frontend.

*This is only about VKD customers. The Wizard has got nothing to do with UME/ VF West customers* ;;;","22/Oct/24 8:44 PM;ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com;[~gaurav.lanjewar1@vodafone.com]  maybe you can check with OSF design team if we need OSF CR for change of the behavior as proposed by Cable

What about a solution the other way round, means Wizard adds the missing Titles in their corresponding tables C_NAME_TITLE_A and

That would be quicker/easier, and we would not cut the possibilities/options in OSF.

Please find below screenshot:

!image-2024-09-12-20-31-35-575.png|width=328,height=282!

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Login to Omnius as Telesales channel.
2. Create Mobile Prepaid package.
3. Proceed to checkout.
4. Save offer using Sent to BO button.
5. Retrieve saved offer using offer manager (Agent is having *CS_VIA_LETTER* permission).
6. Clicks on edit offer and verify Die Vertragszusammenfassung wird als Brief versendet message.

Actual: Omnius is showing Contract summary will be sent a letter message when agent retrieved saved Mobile Prepaid Offer.

Expected: Omnius should not show this message for Mobile Prepaid as Contract Summary is not required (not yet implemented).

Reference stories: OS-4172 OMNIUS CHCK - As an agent in Telesales, I want to move to Voicelog in case contractual documents are not needed for print and signature, so that I can send the order to fulfillment. OS-4172 - Vodafone Global Jira

OS-21136 Omnius _CHCK: As an agent, I want to see overview summary at the end of the checkout in case customer has opted for CS via letter OS-21136 - Vodafone Global Jira

------------------

so - the situation is as follows:

1) For use case save offer which is described in this ticket, we receive ""ContractSummaryCreationInd = 'False'"" Response from OGW in GenerateContract -> CORRECT

2) The customer is not getting CS document - not via email and not via letter for this use case -> CORRECT 

3) For some reason, Omnius shows *Die Vertragszusammenfassung wird als Brief versendet* in Voice Log, +although it does not make any sense at all+ based on point 1 & 2 -> *{color:#de350b}WRONG{color}*

Steps to Reproduce:
 # Login to Omnius as Telesales channel.
 # Create valid Mobile SOHO Business with or without skeleton contract.
 # Proceed to checkout and verify payment (Zahlungsoptionen) section.
 # Select Direct Debit (Per Bankeinzug) option in Monthly payment (Monatliche Zahlungsdaten) section.
 # Select Account holder is a different person (Abweichender Kontoinhaber) section and fill mandatory details.
 # Select ByInvoice (Per Rechnung) payment option in Hardware payment (Zahlungsart für Ihre Lieferung) section.
 # Account holder is a different person (Abweichender Kontoinhaber) section is deselected and Omnius select Customer is account holder (Kunde ist Kontoinhaber) section.
 # When agent again select Account holder is a different person (Abweichender Kontoinhaber), Contact person name is erase from input field.

Actual: Different account holder section is deselected when agent select ByInvoice option in Hardware payment section.

Expected:
 # Different account holder section should not be deselected when agent select ByInvoice option in Hardware payment section or change payment method in Hardware payment section.
 # If current behavior is expected, then Contact person name should not be erase from input field.

As discussed.

In Omnius, companyname input field was introduced in wave1 with length restriction 30 chars

And after there was nothing change in restriction. also not requested to change in SOHO business epic. So its working as agreed design.

So, conclusion is its not a defect.

If it's needed to change then it must be change via new demand or CR to design and analyzed the impacted system.;;;","19/Sep/24 3:11 PM;natasa.dimovic1@vodafone.com;Hi [~thorsten.lehnert@vodafone.com] could you please check if a new CR is needed for this issue?

-----------------

I uploaded a new cable pcat to the pcat-int with support for a proxy parameter as discussed today in the call.

The pcat version is V2410_2024_09_00_079_D01.

[@Sandeep Kumar Pradhan|mailto:SP00123672@Techmahindra.com]/[@Akhilesh Sawarkar|mailto:Akhilesh.Sawarkar@TechMahindra.com] please provide an implementation {_}{{_}}asap{{_}}{_}.
The change is simply in the constructor of the `RemoteServiceParameters` class which now takes an additional optional parameter `proxy`:
> public function __construct(string $url, string $username, string $password, string $productSetupVersion, string $proxy = """")

The proxy can be provided in the form of “<some host/ip>:<some port>” for example.

[@Sandeep Kumar Pradhan|mailto:SP00123672@Techmahindra.com] regarding your comment: “Also an open point is that with this proxy setting of plugin version we need to check if that will work on OSE web server as well where it is working fine at the moment without proxy”. That is correct, however the correct proxy value {_}{{_}}must{{_}}{_} be provided by Omnius, there is no way of guessing the correct value for the cable rules plugin. Whether or not Omnius needs a separate configuration for this I honestly do not really care, the option to pass the value into the plugin exists and Omnius now has to provide the correct values.;;;","20/Sep/24 11:33 AM;gauri.bhagat@vodafone.com;Latest comments updated by Simon after the deployment on SIT -

Hi Natasa,

Could you please provide the *CheckServiceability logs(I08)* and *Validate address* *logs(I03)* for this address

*Strandallee 18, 26969 Butjadingen*

 

because in our ST Env when we tried to reproduce this issue, we need to create stub for this particular address or else when we check the serviceability for the same address getting below message as highlighted in yellow color.

Hi Natasa,
 
 As Discussed in teams group chat,  the district is *Burhave* for which area code as checked is 04733

!1375cf5d-21c1-4463-96e3-14a6a35996ee.png!

PFA

But we are getting 04736 in OGW response 

!cc0adafa-9c95-43a1-8b91-179e67701164.png!

Thats why it is causing error in sky system this need to be checked with OGW team to send respective area code.

the issue is that sos is not getting trigger in WF.
because of that we will not see some of the logs and push order status will not get trigger.

can we have a call with Infra team to check if we have any issue with Kafka?
seems that OGW is sending the message to Kakfa but its not receiving the message in WF.
can you also invite Parth Dwivedi;;;","09/Sep/24 2:09 PM;taher.golvala@vodafone.com;As per observation orders are reaching BE but only Flows of DSL ILS and Cable New and ILS flows are not triggering correct logs and pushorderstatus.

We encountered a Kafka issue related to consumer group configuration. We have 3 envs that are using the same Kafka server but had different topics. However, they were all configured to use the same consumer group (name of the EG)

ACC env doesn’t have permission to access the Kafka resources for the other envs. As a result, the Kafka listener in ACC was unable to work correctly since it was trying to use the same consumer group as the one being used by other environments. To resolve this, we updated the configuration so that each environment uses a unique consumer group.;;;","12/Sep/24 6:39 PM;taher.golvala@vodafone.com;As we are again facing the issue where logs are not getting generated for all orders in OGW;;;","16/Sep/24 1:30 PM;ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com;Feedback after manual configuration change on Friday

In the fix We added configuration to WF EG: JMS_AUXILIARY_KAFKA_STATUS_EG.

We added group.id to the provider url property.

The problem that we added it incorrectly, so after deployment the group id was in the general properties of the EG and not inside the provider url.

For TID team:

If this happened we don’t need to do any restart, we can change this properties inside JESI admin.
 # Stop the EG JMS_AUXILIARY_KAFKA_STATUS_EG in WF under this path: vfde
 # Click on update EG and to add to the end of provider URL this: &group.id=JMS_AUXILIARY_KAFKA_STATUS_EG_ACC1

After CGTP006 is selected the precondition rules are called, the result of those contains the contains CGTP006 as selected in the output:
{code:java}
{
  ""productId"": ""CGTP006"",
  ""visible"": false,
  ""selected"": true,
  ""refused"": false
} {code}
The next call to the posting rules (after selecting HF5:001) however does simply not contain the container at all. From the cable configuration I do not see an obvious reason why this would be deselected by OSF.

Next step: look into the cable rules plugin logs from OSF and check if the container is deselected by the cable rules plugin or not.;;;","06/Sep/24 3:50 PM;simon.auch@vodafone.com;I reproduced this issue on one of our cloud sandboxes using the same OSE and PCAT version as on the ACC1.
The attached cable-rules-log ([^cable_rules_artifact1105120.log)] shows some interesting behaviour that leads me to believe that this is an OSF issue, or that at least OSF will have to analyse why the products are deselected.

Log analysis:
 * Searching through the logs for CGTP006 (the tariff that was selected) gives the following results:
 ** CGTP006 is not selected in the beginning (""|CGTP006|false|true|false|true|"")
 ** CGTP006 is selected in the input for a few iteration (""|CGTP006|true|true|false|true|"")
 ** CGTP006 is selected in the output for the last iteration where it was selected in the input (""ProductId: CGTP006, visible: false, selected:  true"")
 ** CGTP006 is not selected in the next input (""|CGTP006|false|false|false|true|"")
 * -> OSF deselects the main tariff CGTP006

From the cable configuration that could have this effect I do not see any configuration that should have this effect in this scenario (no radio groups, no relation excludes).

Hi [~akash.ubbu@vodafone.com] 

Based on further analysis it is identified that for the problematic customer we not receiving the SOC details for the tariff as result OSE is not able to identify the Tariff from IB.

We have received only component details but no component SOC details to perform reverse mapping to load IB tariff.

Below is the only data regarding component details without soc details.

Below is the Screenshot of the node we added manually which was missing as part of Mode 2 response.

Does the Subscriber in the Test Setup go also the PricePlan SOC = GY1F24M?

!image-2024-09-03-17-26-38-976.png|width=403,height=186!

Steps to Reproduce:
 # Agent logged in Omnius as Telesales channel.
 # Agent loaded existing Customer which is eligible for second delivery.
 # Agent clicks on SECOND DELIVERY (Zweitversand) button and created a valid shopping cart
 # Agent reached to checkout page on Customer data section.
 # Verify Porting section, delivery section and payment section in checkout.

Expected: 
 # Porting: Section should be in read only mode when Porting was not captured in Original Order/package. means Agent can't captured new porting data.
 # Delivery & Billing Address: If customer is having correct & valid delivery & Biling Address - 
 ## Delivery method should prefilled and read only mode from Original Order/Package.And no change of delivery method is allowed. 
 ##  Agent should see in Payment section in readonly mode and for all section data should be prefillef from Customer installed base.

Hi [~ajay.yashwantbhavar@vodafone.com] 

Based on the further analysis it is identified that the Original is created by the Prospect/New customer (i.e, No address or IBAN on IB) during checkout we are collecting all the information like IBAN address via new IBAN and new address fields.

But when we perform second delivery for such order, we will not have any existing information on customer IB and still system allows customer to capture the address details and show the same address or payment methods which are originally captured during the first order.

This is expected behavior in the above new customer case.

If we perform second delivery for existing customer orders, then it will be in reuse mode with disabled fields for payment and the billing address by picking details from InstallBase.

So, we will deliver the fix only for the first case i.e
 # Porting: Section should be in read only mode when Porting was not captured in Original Order/package. means Agent can't captured new porting data.

Thanks;;;","26/Sep/24 12:21 PM;vikash.saurav@vodafone.com;Issue is Fixed and in internal testing

We received this  EPSM-SOC-0406.xsd  file  in  OCA.000160779 /OC.000160773  (OPM_430.01.24.00)  and this is installed in PR Env as a part of OCA.


Let me clarify the issue here, Currently IT Env is with BSS44 and IT OPM is currently running with Soc version EPSM-SOC-0406.xsd.
In same way as per last OPM deployment [OCA.000160779 /OC.000160773  (OPM_430.01.24.00) ] on PR Env, the similar Soc version has been deployed EPSM-SOC-0406.xsd.

Now both IT and PR OPM is using the same soc version EPSM-SOC-0406.xsd, But from Soc side only IT Env having the latest version 0406.
PR Soc is still running on version 0405, So since the last deployment on PR OPM the incoming requests are using the latest version 0406 but from Soc side its still has the lower version.

That’s the reason the test cases are stuck at Oms-Warte-Antwort step in PR OPM.
To resolve this issue either PR OPM should be downgraded to version EPSM-SOC-0405.xsd or PR Soc version should be upgraded to 0406.

At these adresses it is correct that the customer/agent does not get to select any technician options for a pure KIP order.

[~ajay.yashwantbhavar@vodafone.com] 

Well in short note, this is not a defect.

This is agreed behaviour in *CR659* , when in Omnius UI Agent captured an address the later it validate via service call (ValdiateAddress) And in case when service result multiple address in response for captured address then Omnius shows modal with list of all address received from response to make selection by Agent.

If modal appears multiple place this is because of address is validate via service on multiple palaces during checkout and service result multiple address in response.

 

Hope this is helpful;;;","29/Aug/24 6:16 PM;ajay.yashwantbhavar@vodafone.com;Thanks [~kshitij.srivastava2@vodafone.com] for your input.
But even if Agent selects one of the address from suggested list and select another option in payment section for Hardware payment, Omnius again calls Multiple ValidateAddress service which needs to close every time when it's again appears in payment section.

Also when agent enter valid address & address is validated correctly after that when agent select ByInvoice option for HW payment, Multiple ValidateAddress services are getting triggered, Is this correct behavior ?;;;","29/Aug/24 6:26 PM;ajay.yashwantbhavar@vodafone.com;Additionally, I can see, Multiple result should be shown for same Zipcode (PLZ) but in current case different zipcodes also present which are not relevant with entered address.

Hi Ajay,
 
As per old functionality which we referred the message “Die Vertragszusammenfassung wird als Brief versendet.” is expected when we click on CS will be sent by paper letter checkbox
hope you tested this flow without CS_VIA_LETTER permission.

Hi Ajay,
 
There is nothing changed on s/w and for mobile prepaid there is no CS. And above issue is about the *Die Vertragszusammenfassung wird als Brief versendet* this message and for this message BA @Shruti Kanchan already confirmed there is no preconditions for blocking this message.

*Note:* Omnius decides Contract summary is not needed based on this response/node CreateContractDocument/ContractSummaryCreationInd = 'False';;;","03/Sep/24 1:31 PM;ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com;[~ajay.yashwantbhavar@vodafone.com]  do we have this response and which system is having this configuration false?

CreateContractDocument/ContractSummaryCreationInd = 'False';;;","03/Sep/24 2:03 PM;ajay.yashwantbhavar@vodafone.com;Hi [~ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com] 
Yes, At the time of Contract summary creation Omnius get ""ContractSummaryCreationInd = 'False'"" Response from OGW in GenerateContract (SubmitOrder) Mode response and depends on response, Omnius show ""Contract summary is not required for this order"" Message in product overview section.

Agent saved Offer & Retrieve same offer.;;;","03/Sep/24 2:34 PM;ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com;so - the situation is as follows:

1) For use case save offer which is described in this ticket, we receive ""ContractSummaryCreationInd = 'False'"" Response from OGW in GenerateContract -> CORRECT

2) The customer is not getting CS document - not via email and not via letter for this use case -> CORRECT 

3) For some reason, Omnius shows *Die Vertragszusammenfassung wird als Brief versendet* in Voice Log, +although it does not make any sense at all+ based on point 1 & 2 -> *{color:#de350b}WRONG{color}*

But as per TechM its expected and requested functionality (we do not have any user story request for this dedicated use case).

Means - it has to be handled as improvement CR - right [~bharath.krishnamurthy@vodafone.com]  ?;;;","03/Sep/24 5:23 PM;bharath.krishnamurthy@vodafone.com;[~ajay.yashwantbhavar@vodafone.com] [~ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com]

Hi Ajay/Ari,
 
We have checked the codes and also the design. We do not have a precondition to restrict Mobile Prepaid or MMO or to show contract summary only for MMC. If the change needs to be implemented, it has to be a CR.;;;","09/Sep/24 2:51 PM;ajay.yashwantbhavar@vodafone.com;Hi [~sunilkumar.cm@vodafone.com] [~bharath.krishnamurthy@vodafone.com]

This issue is occurring for each order for ACC1, Please find below order details:

Yes they are sending to the router in ACC2 hence we found the getorderrequest(ACC1) logs from ACC2 logs 

;;;","22/Aug/24 5:46 PM;ran.farjun1@vodafone.com;what i mean Nassir, that they are sending to the router in ACC2.

then it will check in ACC1, ACC2, ACC3.

but, the router in ACC2 doesn't have the fix for this issue, hence we are getting the error also in ACC1.
the problem is with the payload that the ACC2 router is creating and sending;;;","22/Aug/24 6:14 PM;ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com;[~ran.farjun1@vodafone.com]  but the main router is on ACC2, not sure what you mean.

the defect was close because a fix was provided and tested. 

as far as i know router is on ACC1.
if its not we should provide the fix to wave 9 as well.

Router is on ACC1 ;;;","23/Aug/24 5:22 PM;ran.farjun1@vodafone.com;Hi Ari,

as i said fix is only in ACC1 wave 9.1.

the error mention in here coming from acc2 router: <2024-08-22 11:57:25,164> <ERROR> <JESI> [Tid:https-jsse-nio-{color:#FF0000}8102{color}-exec-401066]:Exception

Due to this issue, VKD system is adding FIRMA as a salutation for this request in backend but When customer is activated in backend and agent tries to perform in-life sales flow on same customer, Omnius asking to select value for salutation field.

As discussed - Omnius is having only Mr & Mrs values for Cable SOHO customer in checkout & VKD backend is having only FIRMA value for salutation in backend for Legal customer.

i need some input regarding the handling of TV and KIP.
we are getting 2 order lines. 1 KIP, 2.TV

so in that case, what will be the input to KD?

Maybe you could also attach the request you are referring to?;;;","03/Sep/24 4:49 PM;ran.farjun1@vodafone.com;Hi Simon,
this is the request:
[^submit_wrong.xml]

i will try to explain again.
the second order line is TV, but there is no ADD or DROP ComponentActivityType in that order line, only EXISTING.

currently in the code if we have order line with tv we need to have also some ComponentActivityType as DROP or ADD.
because we didnt consider this could happened we are sending by mistake the KIP array inside the TV Array.

if i will fix it the TV Array now will be empty.
my question should we send it empty?

 ""serviceLineId"": ""TV"",
                ""products"": []

or we should sent this section at all?
this will be remove:

There was a discussion especially about ILS flows and the feedback from Business was:

At ILS there is no “nationality” field for DSL and cable orders, but there is for mobile. The mandatory field will then be empty in the future, meaning you will have to ask the customer again about his or her nationality.

 

Actually we also discussed if it should not be displayed for Mobile ILS, this was wrong from business perspective. But Thorsten Lehnert decided to not change anything, so Mobile is different than DSL/ Cable.

So from my point of view its not a defect as field is not expected for DSL and Cable ILS

Let me clarify on this issue and action plan of it.

1) CR-760 piece of code (OSE) is not added in any server except  ACC3,  neither in ACC1 nor ACC2 etc.

Now the next point is why these behavior of CR760 pop-up on all stack

Reason for above: Since CR760 has not only OSE but also OIL and UM api development is there
                  since OIL version deployed equal higher ACC1 (24.07.11.09105) the CR760 OIL code is there(as a part of higher branch merges) which reflected the portion of CR760 in sanity so discussed with Marcin to manage the OIL build so that CR760 OIL code base is reflected in ACC3 and not on ACC1 /W9.1 environment
                  soon we will release a patch to  OIL ACC1 so that CR760 behavior available in ACc3 only until go-live ;;;","14/Aug/24 1:30 PM;vikash.saurav@vodafone.com;hi [~gaurav.lanjewar1@vodafone.com]  this issue is fixed and in internal testing ;;;","14/Aug/24 4:28 PM;bharath.krishnamurthy@vodafone.com;Delivered CN # KIAS2000_CN_18681 for wave9.1  OIL Patch  delivery towards ACC1

as promised I checked it in production.

Some days ago we had similar issues.

For this the following ticket was created [[OTF-196] CR553 Ensure sequence when processing SetOrderStatus / SetFNOrderStatus - Vodafone Global Jira|https://eur03.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fjira.sp.vodafone.com%2Fbrowse%2FOTF-196&data=05%7C02%7Calka.kshirsagar2%40vodafone.com%7C649fd70bc37b47f9eb2808dca7bcb364%7C68283f3b84874c86adb3a5228f18b893%7C0%7C0%7C638569676172322527%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&sdata=HpAV6MhA1jfjElK%2F5pmlqXDTz8dNEpoKz6hVAqB3SAk%3D&reserved=0] and implemented AFAIK.;;;","19/Jul/24 4:20 PM;ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com;Remark: This issue was already observed before deployment of OGW FD  CN_18610 yesterday, so its not related to this delivery ;;;","21/Jul/24 1:26 PM;ran.farjun1@vodafone.com;Hi,

i saw what Marco wrote. but it is the issue.

OGW is picking the status at the same time

!image-2024-07-21-10-52-51-438.png!

these 2 statuses working at the same time. 

in our case the completed success process is finishing 1 second before so you are seeing the push order status completed success first.

InProgress-FulfillmentStarted is finishing 1 second after the completed success, so you will see push order status  InProgress-FulfillmentStarted last.

 

 

!image-2024-07-21-10-56-55-623.png!;;;","22/Jul/24 7:40 PM;ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com;[~ran.farjun1@vodafone.com]  maybe you can detail the scenario bit more in context of CR553 (not the enhancement, but the solution which is already in place)

For every transaction considered for handling, OGW will search for the transactions by OrderID in the subscribe table.
 * If no other entries found, process the current transaction.
 * If +legacy+ timestamp (or its analogue – ts+sequence, like in KIAS) is populated:
 * If younger (by {+}*legacy timestamp*{+}) +processed+ entries found, the order of transactions was violated. SKY ticket should be opened, and the flow suspended until resolution.
 * Else if older (by {+}*legacy timestamp*{+}) +unprocessed+ entries found, pick the earliest unprocessed entry and handle it.

what is our expectation now in the context of this ticket.
The timestamp of the status is not exactly the same, but in between there are just miliseconds. 
So this is not covered by CR553 introducted in wave 7.x?;;;","22/Jul/24 7:54 PM;ran.farjun1@vodafone.com;the issue is that OGW will pick the correct sos from the db, but it will not stop there.

it will not wait until the entire process of InProgress-FulfillmentStarted is finished. 

so in that case InProgress-FulfillmentStarted has an advantage of a few miliseconds, but seems the flow of InProgress-FulfillmentStarted is a bit slower then completed-success.

so what happened is that completed-success is finishing a few miliseconds before and sending push order status.

after a few miliseconds inProgress-FulfillmentStarted is finishing and also send push order status, and because its the last one its reflecting in frontEnd;;;","22/Jul/24 9:49 PM;ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com;[~ran.farjun1@vodafone.com]  means its not about the picking, but about the runtime of the process?

if earlier status needs longer processing than latest status it will not work?

Is this correction part of CR553 enhancement? Or who needs to change something in the behavior? ;;;","23/Jul/24 11:21 AM;ran.farjun1@vodafone.com;sos for the same order need to be sent with a space of more then half a second.

i think even if we will get it with 2 or 3 seconds a part the process will be as expected.

 ;;;","23/Jul/24 12:04 PM;ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com;[~ran.farjun1@vodafone.com]  thanks for your quick feedback. Means as long as backend is not sending it with more space it will not work.

However, there is no way to control / delay the backend responses so we have to accept the behavior?;;;","23/Jul/24 12:18 PM;ran.farjun1@vodafone.com;right, if there is not a delay of a few seconds currently i dont think ogw can handle without some design change.
but, i think the Kafka solution in 9.1 can maybe help in this situation. ;;;","23/Jul/24 12:52 PM;ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com;[~ran.farjun1@vodafone.com]  CR553 enhancement was not scoped for Wave 9.1 release. I tried to clarify since more than 2 months but without any luck. Therefore its too late to take it as regular part of the release.

Means - it stays switched off like in Wave 9.0.
If there is enough time to include the test still in 9.1 (in case rest of sofware is working fine) we will decide to activate it later

[~alka.kshirsagar2@vodafone.com]  I assume to keep the defect for now on hold, as we will not have any solution at the moment.
We can check it again once CR553 enhancement might be activated but even then its not clear if it will work ;;;","28/Aug/24 4:03 PM;ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com;[~satish.dhere1@vodafone.com]  we deployed the delivery from Amdocs for CR553 enhancement to ACC1 Wave 9.1 . we can give it a try if this helped for this ticket but on ACC1 only;;;","28/Aug/24 7:04 PM;satish.dhere1@vodafone.com;Retest is in progress.

Hi, Ariadne,

{*}{color:#de350b}yes, I can confirm that in any case where we book KIP + TV (no matter if Broadvision or not, no matter which order we book it in), no technician section should be shown{color}{*}. 

The reason why this fails is as I tried to point out in my comment below. It really is pretty confusing, I apologize for that. I had a call with Natasa where I explained the problem, because it really is a bit hard to grasp.

So again in case of Broadvision what happens is:
 - [In the KIP package] KIP is booked, TV Connect is added because of Broadvision ---> OSF understands that no section for KIP should be shown because KIP + TV is booked and remembers that

 - [In the TV package] TV Digital is booked ---> OSF understands that no section for TV should be shown because KIP+TV is booked

==> no KIP or TV technician section is shown

In case of Not-Broadvision:
 - [In the KIP package] Only KIP is booked, but not TV yet ----> OSF supposes that a technician section should be shown for KIP (because only KIP is booked) and remembers that
 - [In the TV package] TV Digital + TV Connect is booked ----> OSF understands that no section for TV should be shown because KIP+TV is booked, but doesn't update the reasoning for KIP

==> technician section is shown for KIP, but not for TV;;;","10/Jul/24 8:34 PM;tobias.pohlmann@vodafone.com;Hi guys,

so, yesterday, we were asked by [~timo.russo@vodafone.com] to change the behaviour for KIP-only bookings, too; [[PSTBUG-2380] OSF_One Sehberetischaft option is available on NE3, NE4 VVO and MNV addresses in OSF while booking KIP only for new customers - DE Jira (vodafone.com).|https://de.jira.agile.vodafone.com/browse/PSTBUG-2380]

With this change (product setup version V2390_2024_07_00_086), this symptom here will not occur anymore, so I guess we could close this ticket. I apologize for the confusion.

But the underlying bug – OSF doesn't update the technician options it will display for KIP when it is currently in the TV package – still needs to be fixed as it is also the cause for https://jira.sp.vodafone.com/browse/OS-58440 .;;;","15/Jul/24 12:36 PM;ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com;[~tobias.pohlmann@vodafone.com]  so means we should keep ticket OS-58435 on hold until it got fixed by PSTBUG-2380 and assign it to you instead of TechM?;;;","15/Jul/24 1:25 PM;tobias.pohlmann@vodafone.com;Yes, we can do that.

This issue is fixed in product_setup V2390_2024_07_00_086 for *self-install* addresses. But not yet for *not-self-install* addresses. Since this is a bit more involved we will do this with a different requirement that  [~timo.russo@vodafone.com] is currently writing but which is not quite here yet. 
So, this might come in PI-31 (not the upcoming one, but the one after).

I'd suggest to keep this open and assigned to me for now.;;;","18/Jul/24 2:22 PM;ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com;Thanks Tobias, please inform us when we can retest for not-Self-Install adress;;;","08/Aug/24 12:52 PM;natasa.dimovic1@vodafone.com;Hi [~tobias.pohlmann@vodafone.com] any update?

It is a candidate for the upcoming PI 24-31, which will start in the second half of September.

 Ah yes, you are correct.
We didn't do anything yet, but since OSF in the mean time fixed this bug:
OS-58440 OSF | Wave 9.0 | CR716 Futurize | Regression | when booking 1st TV and then KIP (not Broadvision) the technician option for TV is displayed in the Access Details - Vodafone Global Jira

this here is also solved. 

So, we can close this now. Thanks for bringing my attention back to this.

Sorry, I am uncertain: may I just close this, or does anyone with more authority need to do that?

Because, I just re-checked that bug (OS-58440) which was re-tested and marked as solved according to the comments, but when testing it now on ACC1 I still have the old problem, too. So, if I first book TV and then KIP and then go to checkout, then the technician option for TV is displayed.

Not sure if it came back somehow (or I am just confused right now), but I think once OS-58440 is fixed, OS-58435 should be fixed as well. And for me it looks like, both bugs are still present on ACC1.;;;","19/Oct/24 1:30 PM;natasa.dimovic1@vodafone.com;[~tobias.pohlmann@vodafone.com] you were right.

We have created a new bug for the same issue: OS-63508 OSF | Wave 9.1 | Regression | when booking 1st TV and then KIP (not Broadvision) the technician option for TV is displayed in the Access Details - Vodafone Global Jira this bug was resolved and could be retested successfully.

I've retested this bug here (OS-58435) again:

We will remove this feature that is incorrectly calculated by OSF in the scope of [[PORPDT-536] VKD Removal of Ready-to-Watch (Sehbereitschaft) Section - Part II (770375) - DE Jira|https://de.jira.agile.vodafone.com/browse/PORPDT-536]  anyway, so maybe it is not worth it to push OSF to do it, even though it is clearly still faulty Omnius-behaviour.

We are now not displaying the technician section when booking KIP only or KIP+TV.

For this reason, the technician state cannot leak from KIP to TV anymore (or rather, it will leak over, but it doesn't matter anymore).

Could you please re-test and confirm?;;;","30/Jan/25 6:22 PM;tobias.pohlmann@vodafone.com;The root problem persists – the KIP technician state is not updated when changes in the TV package are made. However, the business case changed on cable side with PORPDT-536, so that now, both for KIP-only customer as well as TV+KIP customer we do not want to show any section.

 ;;;","09/Jul/24 6:41 PM;vishal.raut@vodafone.com;Hi all,

FYI as discussed in call, 
All the required data (OIL Logs, OSE logs, Lumen logs) has been shared with Waseem for further investigation.

Waseem will check and Sandeep will update for further action that needs to be done. ;;;","10/Jul/24 5:09 PM;gauri.bhagat@vodafone.com;Below are some of the findings after the call with Waseem,

It has impact ONLY IF all three switches are Yes If anyone of them is No then there is no impact. We have checked in PROD all three switches are set to 'No' So ACC team cannot decide for PROD, decision has to take by Fusion C team if they want Switches Yes. ;;;","10/Jul/24 6:57 PM;sandeepkumar.pradhan@vodafone.com;Hi All,

{*}Why issue Occurred{*}: Since all the 3 field for CustomerDataHUB Solution1 Settings and CustomerDataHUB Settings  such as

CustomerDataHUB Solution1 Settings 
1)Central Search ES Interfaces Enabled

CustomerDataHUB Settings
1)Legacy search and MRT Enabled
2)Enable CDH Interface
are set to ""Yes"" which breaks the API flow in current OSE build  which is not the case in ACC1 or PROD
in both these environment at least one of the them or all are set as ""NO"" where both customer search and Installed base working fine (for PRODUCTION all filed set as NO)


{*}Action plan{*}: we need to work with Vodafone design team to understand on what criteria these all filed need to switch on (Set as yes) after that or parallelly we need look from OSE prospective how we can handle these API irrespective of setting (all 3 set to YES or all 3 set to NO(working condition) or partial set of YES and NO (working condition))
 

Also PROD and ACC2 are almost equal we should ensure that ACC2 setting always same that of PROD else conf change leads to issue like this , Do understand that tACC2 setting can be change too for testing but it has to be known to an extent;;;","11/Jul/24 12:02 PM;ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com;[~sandeepkumar.pradhan@vodafone.com]  the settings on ACC and in PROD will never be exactly same, as we are always testing future topics in ACC which might not be live yet.
However, for these Fusion C switches we had topics in scope for different releases, so the functionality itself is live since a long time but with a technical go live.

1)[OS-8975] SOL0 - Search & display customer with product(s) mastered in solstice - Vodafone Global Jira -> implemented with Wave 7.0, tested with Wave 7.1  

2) [OS-11283] SOL1SE32 - Extending the OSF Search for Solstice Customers - Vodafone Global Jira -> initially implemented with Wave 7.2, because of needed enhancement tested again with Wave 9.0 

We are not having any new functionality, the switches are there since years. 
To retest your TechM fix for OS-56961 of course all switches had to be YES and in release Wave 9.0 they have been on YES in general most of the time, as OS-11283 was part of Wave 9.0 and tested by Fusion C team.

As ACC1 was used for Wave 8.2 of course ACC1 was different, as there only OS-8975 was live already (therefore only one switch was enabled) 

And as its technically live, Fusion C team can decide at any time to switch it ON in production. Its like any other technical go live, where functionaly is enabled in ACC but not yet in production.;;;","12/Jul/24 2:24 PM;ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com;Workaround: We have switched OFF SOL1 search for now, Fusion C team was informed about the situation and asked for solution / change

This can be either fixed by disabling the CDH sol1 search (elastic search) or increasing the threshold of displayed customers in the admin setting UI. fyi [~peter.nestvogel@vodafone.com];;;","22/Jul/24 4:56 PM;ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com;Internal TechM call with C1/Fusion is planned to discuss on further handling of this defect ;;;","12/Aug/24 8:31 PM;ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com;[~vikash.saurav@vodafone.com]  we need an update on this ticket to know how to handle the fusion C switch for extended search ;;;","22/Aug/24 4:03 PM;ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com;Talked to Vikas today, team wants to reproduce the issue on ACC2. Therefore we would need to activate the Fusion C search for some time, this needs to be aligned with [~gauri.bhagat@vodafone.com]  / [~ajay.bhavar@vodafone.com] ;;;","27/Aug/24 7:14 PM;akhilesh.sawarkar@vodafone.com;We attempted to replicate this in the ACC2 environment with Shweta and Sneha, and it appears that the CS API is functioning properly for both Fixed and Cable with all CDH interfaces enabled (which means all three switches are set to 'Yes').

Hi All.

We delivered a debug patch for this issue to ACC1 on 17/12 under the reference CN#KIAS2000_CN_18936 however that debug patch didn’t help much to fix the issue and also didn’t indicate reason for failed again so we are validating further more on it, Soon we will update the action plan and that action plan include is to validate with API expert to Fastrack this issue resolution.,;;;","20/Dec/24 2:12 PM;daniel.loos@vodafone.com;regarding this specific error message, please be aware that enabling the extended search will also enable this unrelated setting in the default configuration:

after the call today we can see that the flow is on standBy because no customer id is sent to ogw.

Checked OSE/OGW calls where correct BEW update version with customer id is sent at UM backend where in Cable logs we see the request getting sent to UM via Minerva asking to update Version 4-- but somehow it seems UM is not updating Version 4 at their end - PFA SS for reference
For detail analysis check we need UM team support to check for this issue;;;","02/Jul/24 3:14 PM;rohan.kumbhar@vodafone.com; !screenshot-1.png|thumbnail! 

Tried new order for BEW with below details --same issue that from backend OSF is not getting the correct updated version as 4 in getcustomer details due to which the button is enabled for Unity media flow
customer id:953464201
documentID: 10875779;;;","03/Jul/24 12:53 AM;rohan.kumbhar@vodafone.com;here we see issue from Minerva adapter -- email sent to UM team to check on this issue 
;;;","04/Jul/24 6:28 PM;rohan.kumbhar@vodafone.com;As per the latest call on BEW topic.. there is a design GAP for the BEW flows which needs to be discussed by VF Design team.
as of now the problem here for this flow is that in the GetCustomerDetails Mode 3 call Omnius is always receiving BEWVersion as ""0"" irrespective of any other version is sent from OSF. So there is no checks nor validation of this BEW version at legacy backend and everytime Cable/UM will send Version 0 only.
So this is a design gap and currently this defect needs to be kept ON_HOLD until further clarification;;;","09/Jul/24 3:00 PM;ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com;[~rohan.kumbhar@vodafone.com]  who is taking this point now to discuss about unitymedia?
As its not only BEW only Retail which is not wroking, but also not for Telesales new customers in case its not IPCC triggered, and Retail new customers have never been tested.

So a general discussion is required?;;;","11/Jul/24 7:56 PM;ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com;[~rohan.kumbhar@vodafone.com]  based on the latest calls e have the following findings for Retail BEW and unitymedia in general

1) New customer, Retail, order + BEW -> Backend receives and stores BEW correctly

2) Existing customer, Retail, order + BEW -> Backend receives and stores BEW correctly

3) Existing customer, Retail, BEW only ->{color:#de350b} *Backend receives and stores BEW correctly? Please confirm this*
{color:#172b4d}What is wrong in all cases -> Frontend OSF is not able to retrieve the right BEW settings. So if BEW was updated in UNitymedia backend, Frontend is not reflecting this. It still looks like no BEW is set{color} ** 
{color:#172b4d}We will also compare the same for VKD, how Retrievecustomerinfo Mode 3 related to BEW permissions is looking like{color}{color};;;","12/Jul/24 3:20 PM;rohan.kumbhar@vodafone.com;As per latest observation it seems that Problem is happening only for the Unity Media customers when they chose BEW Options.
We tried 1 Cable New acquisition where BEW were correctly updated at backend and then we tried to fetch the same customer on OSF portal where correct Version status was reflected in GetCustomerDetails call and also BEW Button was disabled.

;;;","12/Jul/24 7:08 PM;ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com;[~rohan.kumbhar@vodafone.com]  the ticket itself is only for Unitymedia, so for VKD its not a problem and no ticket reported.

We still need to document here, if the Existing customer, Retail, BEW only for Unitymedia is reaching the backend as ticket says 

_*{color:#de350b}BEW version is not updating in Unity Backend{color}* and BEW Erfassen is enable even after update the version._

 

At the moment we assume, BEW version is getting updated in Unity backend, but we cannot retrieve the GetPermissions because its not giving back the correct version 
Unitymedia is handling permissions with Version 2, OGW expecting Version  4 and for retrieval of existing permissions we get Version 0.

Needs to be checked with responsible person from MinervaAdapter (VKD side);;;","17/Jul/24 2:34 PM;ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com;No progress yet as we did not identify the responsible person who can help with Minerva Adapter VKD ;;;","18/Jul/24 9:28 PM;ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com;I have enclosed the latest discussion.
As per latest analysis this problem is related to the way back from Unitymedia via Minerva Adapter VKD to OGW

{color:#de350b}*OK:*{color} OGW version 4 -> Minerva Adapter maps Version 4 from the VKD request into Version 2 for the request to UME/VFW -> UME/VFW is storing Version 2 correctly in Mood and showing right entries in RNS for the customer 

{color:#00875a}*Not OK*{color}: Now when we open the customer who has given BEW again in OSF, we expect that the stored BEW is taken and we are not asked to capture BEW again. Problem: For this get_permission Call we are receiving version 0 for the mentioned scenarios and we cannot map this version to our valid Version 4 (not OK)

{+}*Gap*{+}: We need a Mapping: UME/VFW is sending back Version 2 to Minerva Adapter-> Minerva Adapter maps Version 2 to Version 4 if getpermission request is coming from OGW

 

I have shared the feedback also with Jörg Trierweiler, Thomas Schneider, Andreas Baldermann and few more people to verify.
This is a general topic and not specifically related to BEW only Retail Epic
Waiting for feedback about possible next steps;;;","11/Aug/24 5:06 PM;ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com;I did not receive an answer yet from the experts how to handle this defect. However, I remind them again (Due to vacation might need some time until they reply).

[~natasa.dimovic1@vodafone.com]  the cable promo’s you are referring are goodies which are direct products, but for DSL its promotions means its part of a product vodafone secure Net+

you cannot choose this product(GS_SN_3x3_99[br]) individually it comes with vodafone secure Net+

hence the NEU comes to actual product not the promotion associated to it.

HI [~natasa.dimovic1@vodafone.com] 

Did some analysis on code level identified that as mention by Michael Friedrich there is no special handling for promos.

We show NEW tag for those products whose system action is 'add'(which means the products which are not added by Install base or dropped in cart) and sale type is one of these “RETBLU,RETNOBLU,RETTER,ILSBLU,ILSNOBLU”.

This is working as expected

So there is a plenty of stuff tagged with ""NEU""  - so in general it works.  But why doesn't have the discounts (GS_DSL_BOOST .... or GS_SN_3x3_99....) the NEU Tag then? (these are not coming from installed base - so why its missing?)

we are getting the subscriber number for every orderLine but the problem is we are getting the set order status in the same second:

because of this the CDM is not getting update correctly and 1 of the orderLine missing the subscriber number, and if this is missing the Marsh file will not be created for that order line.

this is the timepStamp from the set order status:

the generation of the Marsh File for SOHO Firma is 'technically' from OGW side not possible.

My understanding was that therefore it should not be possible in OSF to order the insurance options Cover/Cover Plus for customer type=SoHo Firma.

 

The Insurance Option are still shown on ACC2 for customer type SOHO Firma, can you pls check:

!image-2024-06-25-12-08-42-076.png!;;;","25/Jun/24 5:29 PM;thomas.jerke@vodafone.com;This is a design gap. In the test case has a customer type SOHO and a consumer tariff which seems to be an edge case.

The Logic which handset insurance could be booked for SOHO is based on the tariffs. So for enterprise tariffs the cover socs are not allowed.

Also for legacy insurance 24HATAV23 and the old Cover Plus SOCs CO3* no rule exists to restrict them based on customer type.

We need to keep this defect on hold until we will get delivery on ACC. Anyhow we will get delivery on production but in future it will get merged with ACC and it was also tested multiple times (Since it was valid defect ) so, let's keep it on hold and post that we will retest it, or we will decide in future.

The following SOCs shall only be bookable by consumer users (Private consumers, SOHO without RV, Companies without RV) and shall +not+ be bookable by business users (SOHO with RV, Companies with RV):

in this fix the 24 retry will not be in use anymore, instead the retry will be determined by the ogw_error_handler table.

it will decide how many times to retry, and how much time to wait between the calls.

for this flow the retry will be active for empty response from oneDMS or OGWERR-9900 error code return

for example:
this is a record from the table:

{
    ""ERROR_CODE"":""OGWERR-9900"",
    ""ERROR_CATEGORY"":""Technical"",
    ""IGNORE_ERROR_IND"":""N"",
    ""RETRYABLE_IND"":""TRUE"",
    ""MAX_RETRY_TIMES"":""3"",
    ""RETRY_WAIT_TIME"":""10"",
    ""MAX_WAIT_TIME"":null,
    ""STATUS_TO_SET"":null,
    ""CHANNEL"":""TELESALES"",
    ""SERVICE_CALL"":""ASYNC"",
    ""SERVICE_NAME"":""OneDMS""
}
so the flow will retry 3 times and the wait time will be 10 seconds between every try.;;;","16/May/24 4:05 PM;ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com;informed [~kirill.leibov1@vodafone.com]  to get in touch with Ran to discuss if the solution is ok from vodafone side;;;","17/May/24 1:34 PM;kirill.leibov1@vodafone.com;The existing solution with 24 tries must be {+}not removed{+}, but it shall remain as the +default+ behavior in the case, that we do not have no configuration in the ogw_error_handler table.;;;","19/May/24 1:34 PM;ran.farjun1@vodafone.com;thanks Kiril,

Hi Natasa ,

But the response from DXL should have this pin towards OSE,if not how will we process the pin.;;;","06/Feb/24 2:50 PM;natasa.dimovic1@vodafone.com;Hi [~vikash.saurav@vodafone.com] could you please tell me to whom to assign the defect then? Thank you;;;","06/Feb/24 3:08 PM;vikash.saurav@vodafone.com;HI [~natasa.dimovic1@vodafone.com]  Please assign to DXL team. ;;;","06/Feb/24 3:15 PM;natasa.dimovic1@vodafone.com;Hi [~rohan.kumbhar@vodafone.com] could you please check this issue with the DXL team? Thank you;;;","07/Feb/24 4:40 PM;natasa.dimovic1@vodafone.com;Hi [~vikash.saurav@vodafone.com] the customer 934800577 is a VKD KUD customer, but on a Unity Media address. This seems to be the issue

This is the answer from Raniero:

You need to check with OSF, this is what OSF is sending:
and OSF is sending a request for an UM customer (BW = Baden Württenberg).

This is a urn for a VKD customer:

This is a urn for a UM customer:

!image-2024-02-07-12-09-00-539.png!

In SoapUI you are sending a request for a VKD customer, OSF sends a request for an UM customer.

Could you please check that again? Thanks;;;","07/Feb/24 5:33 PM;vikash.saurav@vodafone.com;Divya Kumbla added a comment -
 
 
Hi [~natasa.dimovic1@vodafone.com]  ,Again the decision of whether the customer is VKD or UM is based on AccountCategory in getCustomerResult for index search

and Region in retrieveCustomerInfo mode1 for Legacysearch.

For reference

!image-2024-02-07-17-32-45-292.png!

So we need to check what is coming for this customer for which you need to share the search response and mode1 response logs.;;;","07/Feb/24 6:06 PM;natasa.dimovic1@vodafone.com;Hi [~vikash.saurav@vodafone.com] please find attached the logs;;;","08/Feb/24 1:12 PM;vikash.saurav@vodafone.com;Divya Kumbla added a comment -
 
Hi [~natasa.dimovic1@vodafone.com] 

As said earlier the region from mode1 decides if its VKD or UM, and as per attached logs we receive region as UME-KBW hence OSE considers it as UM customer.

The issue is that A KUD only customer on a Unity address is handled like a Unity customer but it is a VKD customer. Is this WAD or a bug? Thanks;;;","08/Feb/24 3:43 PM;ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com;[~natasa.dimovic1@vodafone.com]  let me check with Unitymedia team, will take some time 
This scenario never worked in the past, when testing SPIN in the release itself right? I think we did not have tried such a customer.;;;","08/Feb/24 4:04 PM;natasa.dimovic1@vodafone.com;Hi [~ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com] I never tried a VKD KUD customer on a Unity Media address. It is not easy to find such a customer and this customer was found only by chance. Thank you ;;;","13/Feb/24 2:18 PM;ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com;currently checking initial requirements, what was requested in user stories for SPIN, will take some more time. I will keep it on hold for now ;;;","19/Feb/24 8:26 PM;ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com;received some feedback about handling for UM/ VKD in general, need to check and need some days;;;","21/Feb/24 5:57 PM;ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com;still checking with solution design team - As per requirement for index customer search we should check the value AccountCategory -> and for VKD customer it should receive the value KD.

So not sure why the flow here is checking the unitymedia region, if already received KD value 
Will share some more information in some time;;;","23/Feb/24 7:30 PM;ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com;Discussed today with Andreas Baldermann - he is going to document the expected behavior for customer search and display VKD/UM now to further work on this ticket. Will take some time, therefore ticket still on hold;;;","05/Mar/24 6:32 PM;ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com;Andreas is still working on it, he needs to discuss with Kshitij on this topic. Maybe we can get update next week;;;","20/Mar/24 3:10 PM;ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com;Meeting with Kshitij was not happening as planned yet, so no further feedback available on this task;;;","05/Apr/24 7:01 PM;ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com;One meeting took place few days ago but not all points could be discussed and there is again longer meeting organized for next week Tuesday with Kshitij and Andreas.;;;","18/Apr/24 12:36 PM;ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com;There was a meeting between Kshitij and Andreas with following outcome:
 * Values like ""AccountCategory"" in Omnius are derived from OGW: Here:- _AccountCategory_ in getCustomerResult for index search and _Region_ in retrieveCustomerInfo mode1 for LegacySearch.
 * As the ADDRESS REGION is in UM Area - it is treated as UM customer, even though he belongs to the VKD Stack

h4. _Possible SD option to be validated/proven:_ 
 * Derive customer stack from GlobalID prefix (""legacy stack"")  instead of address region
 * IF improvements required as this is only known by OGW (Omnius can only see LK_ from linked customers) - e.g. introducing new attribute to indicate customers product stack:
 * CustomerSearch()
 * getCustomerDetails()
 * [@Mitra, Gaurab, External Vendor|mailto:gaurab.mitra@amdocs.com]: We should investigate if further interfaces have to be considered (To be discussed on next CR meeting)

[@Kshitij.Srivastava@comviva.com|mailto:kshitij.srivastava@comviva.com]: To check UseCases in Omnius to be considered for an improvement

Further benefit: Omnius Performance increase If product stack information is directly provided by OGW 

 

So team is working on possible solution but will take some time ;;;","17/May/24 11:42 AM;ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com;Asked Andreas Baldermann and TEchM for update of status;;;","17/May/24 12:15 PM;ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com;Update: We are still in analysis with TechM and Amdocs. Anyway currently we don’t see an easy solution option to provide this information to Omnius right now

This seems to be generic error as the system cannot differentiate between VKD and Unity anymore on this step

Has to be analysed together with CR676 functionality

for the first request i can see that:

so seems like VKD customer.
for the second request:

else we will sent is as VKD customer;;;","22/Jan/24 8:57 PM;ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com;Hi [~vikash.saurav@vodafone.com]  as per information from Ran something is missing in the setpermission request, so not sure if something is wrong on Ominus/OSE Side? can you please check and share your input? ;;;","24/Jan/24 11:55 AM;vikash.saurav@vodafone.com;SunilkumarCM added a comment - 
 
Hi [~ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com]  ,

I don't see the steps to reproduce and if its for existing customer we need mode logs and serviceability logs between OSE<->OIL & OIL<->OGW.

Thanks

[~alka.kshirsagar2@vodafone.com] fyi;;;","24/Jan/24 3:56 PM;ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com;[~vikash.saurav@vodafone.com]  I was not creating any order, I am just scanning portal UI tool from time to time to find unidentified issues. And within this quality check I have found tickets with this error message. 

 

After some analysis I have identified, that it seems to be this scenario:

-> Search existing unitymedia customer and perform Move to VKD adress 

 

this is example Order ID from ACC1 - it failed with 2 sky tickets

One ticket because of invalid VPKN (issue is solved, please ignore that) and second sky ticket was for setpermission.


Unfortunately Sky ticket were cleared in between so I am not able to find my two tickets anymore..... But hopefully you can reproduce on your environment for a Move from Unity to VKD.

Seems like in this case the existing customer ID from unity is taken over, instead of recognizing that customer will get a new customer ID from VKD for Move scenario

 

Order ID 782545, Customer ID 1009755201 (initial customer before Move) 

!image-2024-01-24-11-21-17-927.png!

 

Same seems to happen when moving from Unity Cable to DSL product. 

So please check flow Unity Cable to VKD Cable Move, and Unity Cable to DSL Move

 ;;;","25/Jan/24 5:24 PM;ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com;We have placed another order yesterday.

*Move from Unity Cable to VKD Cable* with permission selection in checkout.
Omnius Order ID 783467

 

In SetPermission Call I see that its called for Cable - {*}UN{*}, but the target customer is VKD Customer after Move. 



So I would expect in the setpermission call that system is calling VKD with new VKD customer ID, right? It does not make sense to store a permission in unitymedia backend when the customer is going to be inactive there, and will be active only in VKD in the future with new customer ID

Hi [~ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com]  ,

Further based on investigation above is the expected behavior. Which means for the existing customer we are getting the region value from Install Base and if region value which is from the IB or from the serviceability(in ACQ) is not matching with the below table data which is agreed during the design, then OSE send empty <CustomerList><CustomerDetails>{*}<TargetSystem>{*}.

If for any new region value VF expects to send *TargetSystem* value then it has to be added to OSE via SRT

Thank you;;;","09/Jan/24 10:33 PM;ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com;I think the request in Ticket Z_PRT00133532A was somehow different then we have originally expected for our defects, especially related to CR716

 

We are expecting installation section always to be shown for both KIP and TV, to be able to switch to technician or self install manually

*BUT this is not expected as per Ticket from PROD:*

Expected behavior after fix Z_PRT00133532A

This means the option for TV is not visible anymore, if I got it right.

[~ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com] I think the behaviour by OSF that the error message is shown in case a inconsistent technician selection is made by the agent can be assumed to be correct. I at least would not know what the expected outcome of such a selection would be.

The following part from your comment could be the solution to this:

Your assumption regarding the TV section then not being visible is correct.

From our tests I would also assume that the TV section shouldn't be visible in this case [Quelle von vkdTechnicianOptions.feature - productSetup - webgit (kabeldeutschland.de)|https://webgit.kabeldeutschland.de/projects/FE/repos/productsetup/browse/4DevelopmentOnly/tests/unified/features/availability/vkdTechnicianOptions.feature#239-259]:

As per the production ticket, it was mentioned that after selecting the TV product in checkout section and move forward

then the TV Access details should not be visible 

We have tested as per the description in the ticket and we can see that access details is not displayed and able to move forward without error

Yes, exactly, we shouldn't see any of these options anymore for VFW customers. That should already be deployed on ACC2. Once we can confirm it works properly, we can reject this bug (I have never seen this error message, I wonder what causes it).

I double checked in our logs and attached them here as well (cable rules artifact logs), maybe they help.
The scenario I clicked was:
 * load existing KIP customer
 * open kip package
 * open (new) mobile package
 * select any bundle eligible mobile tariff -> bundle drawer pops up
 * create the bundle by clicking the bundle drawer
 * go to checkout -> see message
 * logs of this state: [^cable_rules_artifact_OS47914_pre_workaround.log]
 * open kip package
 * select any option and deselect it again
 * logs of this state:
[^cable_rules_artifact_OS47914_post_workaround.log]

When checking the logs notice that no posting rules are executed after the bundle is created and before the workaround is applied.

Hi Alexander/Simon,

This is not a code issue I have checked working PCAT with the ACC1/ACC2 codebase in my local environment and it's working fine, seems something wrong with the ACC2 PCAT.

I have checked Rules manager and some differences found in the rules also in both the PCAT's so both PCT’s are not same.

*ACC1:*
Total Rules: 73185 
Mobile: 62760
KIP Ruls: 5168
KABLE TV Rules: 4450

*ACC2:*

The problem is, that ACC2 is having January catalogue since today, as PST is testing next release. So maybe first of all the issue has to be reproducable with new catalogue.

Hi Alexander/Simon,
 
 For extended shopping cart min max equal warning rules, there is not relation with cable post rule results or execution.
The rule which is problematic, is a max(0) rule and service to category rule. So if this rule’s service source expression evaluates to true than it will check if cart have max 0 number of products only from the target category. So if product OMNIUSTVCHANGEDMARKER is not part of the package then problematic rule service source expression will evaluate to true and further it will show warning if from target category we have more then 0 products in cart.;;;","14/Dec/23 2:55 PM;simon.auch@vodafone.com;Hi [~bharath.krishnamurthy@vodafone.com],

the relation is implicit, the posting rules select the OMNIUSTVCHANGEDMARKER once there is any change to the package. OSF needs to call the posting rules after any change to cable packages including bundle rules.

Hi Alexander/Simon,
 
The logic implemented long back cannot be modified as it may cause additional adversary problems. However, if you require this logic to be changed, it will require the involvement of design team.;;;","14/Dec/23 4:54 PM;simon.auch@vodafone.com;[~ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com], I am not sure if there was any more specific documentation (I will keep searching for a bit), but the following HLD already has a section:
|*Cable artifact rules*
 
The Cable Catalog and PLM colleagues have requested their own rules engine to be applied in the configurator. This is realised with a plugin development where Cable colleagues can upload their Rules Artifact as part of the PLM process. This Rules Artifact consists of the same Sales Rules (in PHP language/cable-speak) that is used currently in ECC front-ends. OMNIUS will share the full-shoppingcart (all packages) to the Rules Artifact, the rules artifact will process ruling, and return the shoppingcart object with modified cable orderlines in Kabel TV, KIP and KUD packages to be displayed in OMNIUS. The Rules Artifact will be called both before a product is selected (on show of configurator, pre-condition) {*}as well as after selecting a product (on adding to the shoppingcart, post-condition){*}. OMNIUS will not be able to have special GUI handling like for internal OMNIUS sales rules when using the Artifact.|

Highlighting added by me.

From a slightly newer HLD:
|Apart from the Omnius compatibility rules for cable, specific precondition and postcondition rules from cable are also evaluated within the Cable Rules Artifact. *With each change in the configurator (for cable products) the Omnius rules and Cable rules artifact are evaluated in a loop, until a stable state is reached.* |

As explained in the call (and in previous comments on this ticket):

the checkout is blocked by a rule that comes from the pcat because the product OMNIUSTVCHANGEDMARKER is not selected.
the product is added by the posting rules of the cable rules artifact if there is any change to the TV package
after the bundle is created the TV package is changed as it now contains VB4

The product itself however does not seem to indicate that it has a price nor a non standard rate, both of which should however not be necessary for unity inventory products.

It is noteworthy that the product itself has no price configured in the product setup, maybe the display in the contract summary of OSF does not work if it is an inventory product without a price (and without a non standard rate actually configured in the product setup)?

The very first analysis was by me and as far as I can tell nothing in the comments suggests that the assumptions I had were analysed?

For the result of my analysis see the first comment [OS-47333] OSF Wave 8.1 ACC2 - Contract Summary: Price of old TV Product is missing (only OSF) - Vodafone Global Jira.

I also checked again for a random customer having this product that the inventory returned by vkdgateway does indeed contain a price.

TL;DR:

This behaviour is reproducible with a vast range of PCAT versions (basically any version containing UMDKLM should suffice).

The product has no price configured, but for (unity) inventory products the price from the inventory must be used. 
VkdGateway correctly returns a price in the inventory of the customer.

We had a call with TechM team to analyse this defect Further and got the below information from them

They compared the back office configuration between one failed scenario(Digitaler Kabelanschluss m. Service ) and pass scenario(Digital Kabelanschluss)

and made the below changes to their environment to check whether it is working with failed scenario:

 

*1.They tried to change the price of the failed product and product frontend visibilty of the failed product same as the Passed one*

i.e They changed the price of Digitaler Kabelanschluss m. Service from 0 to 20,99 in BO and product Visibility as below (Previously only inverntory is selected for thiis product)

!image-2024-02-21-16-14-57-020.png|width=330,height=141!

And then when checked in front end , We are able to see the product details in front end 

 

*2. As we mentioned that price of the Unity Product should not be taken from Back Office*

To check this one , they tried to change one product price from 20,99 to 20 euros in back office in their environment 

When checked in front end , we are able to see the product price has changed from 20,99 to 20 Euros

[~devi.jampana@vodafone.com] 

As discussed there is no such handling for this usecase; where Overriding of PCAT price with Customer Ibase for any product.

In Omnius; it always consider customer’s Ibase product price from pcat RMM(reverse Multimapped) or via (service all {{{}GetNonStandardRates{}}})

So this is not a defect ruther i would say it must be CR to have such behaviour handle in Omnius.

 Not a valid defect toward Omnius.

CR716 ILS is not in scope. suggest to invistegate with VF Cable team for cable rulez plugin.
Note : *Technician needed* OR *SelfInstallation* dropdown options visiblity and respective product in SC logic is exisitng and controlled via cable rulez plugin.

In CR716
(ABK = Yes or No) and *YES* has only scope if there is *Technician needed* dropdown option possible then make this option preset in readonly AND also not add chargeable product in SC.

Can you please look into the below comment

 

Regards

Srujana;;;","20/Sep/23 4:07 PM;simon.auch@vodafone.com;This can be changed on cable side, but I am relatively sure that this was never implemented for Unity.

Without CR-716 the agent could select both ""Anschluss ist bereits sehbereit"" or ""Anschluss ist nicht sehbereit"" but only ""Anschluss ist bereits sehbereit"" would actually do anything (selecting a marker product).

With CR-716 only the option with a valid product selection is left, but functionally everything behaves just like before.
The agent basically just had the illusion of a choice before.

If this behaviour should be changed I think it needs to be clarified if there are other cases for unity in which (at a self install address) the option ""Anschluss ist nicht sehbereit"" should be selectable. The other ES* products come to mind for example.;;;","22/Sep/23 4:50 PM;nina.pickl@vodafone.com;In clarification:

the technician option should be shown if KIP only is booked or is there an exception when booking ES5? If yes, then I would say the wrong option is displayed.

Thank you;;;","03/Feb/25 1:16 PM;tobias.pohlmann@vodafone.com;Hi [~natasa.dimovic1@vodafone.com]  ,
as I understood it, the technician section should never be shown for a KIP-only booking.

In the excel sheet, there are only 2 cases left in which we want to show the section in OSF, which are both TV-only cases.
!image-2025-02-03-08-44-34-740.png|width=1339,height=527!

For this use case, described in the description, the technician option is still displayed in the Access Details.

We are not sure if everything has already been implemented.

If everything has already been implemented then I would suggest to reject this bug. A new bug should be created then. Could you please check if there is maybe a bug on Cable side? Thank you;;;","03/Feb/25 1:33 PM;tobias.pohlmann@vodafone.com;Ah, okay, now I get it.

The reason why it happens here is that this is a Unity address which historically was treated similarly, but differently than VKD with the technician options.

*Open questions from my perspective:*
 * which products exactly control the display of the tv access details in OSF?
 ** Is it only TECYESTV and TECNOTV or also products like VP0, 1V1?
 ** Is this controlled by special tags on products or categories, or are the products hardcoded in OSF?
Maybe [~vikash.saurav@vodafone.com] can answer this question?
 * If the display of the checkout part is only controlled by TECYESTV and TECNOTV, this will not work (and from cable side never should have) for Unity, since these two products are not aligned and should never be available for Unity.
Which TV technician option should be bookable in Unity TV scenarios? As far as I am aware there is no TV technician product that is available in the Unity footprint.
 *  in which scenarios should which technician option be bookable in OSF?

 * 
 ** we have a list of ~80 test cases. Some of these are apparently not correct.
 ** Who can go through these test cases with us and determine which of them need to be changed?

1) the display of the section does not only depend on TECHNOTV or TECHYESTV in VFW cases and/or

2) the OSF behaviour controlling this section in VFW scenarios changed

If we are following the below steps in ACC2 then we are able to see the Access details even now:

Steps:

1)select TV Product and KIP section 

2)select the TV Product

3)Donot select any product in KIP

4)Move forward it will throw an error that we have to select the KIP Product in check out section

5)Go back and select the KIP Product now

6)Move forward and fill customer details

7)Then we are able to see the access details for TV

Note:we tried this steps 3 to 4 times and we are able to see the access details once

Strange behaviour

This issue can be related to any VKD Permissions?

Srujana;;;","28/Sep/23 8:02 PM;simon.auch@vodafone.com;Hi Devi & Nina,

[~devi.jampana@vodafone.com] for now I would ignore the case you had and focus on the scenario described in the ticket: a TV order without KIP.
I think my initial question is still unanswered:
When does OSF show the access details section for TV in a unity scenario?

If the answer to this question is ""when at least one product in the technician_needed_no or technician_needed_yes category is visible according to the cable product logic"" then the next question we need answered is why was the section shown in previous versions?

[~nina.pickl@vodafone.com] could you figure out a version where this worked last time?;;;","28/Sep/23 8:18 PM;simon.auch@vodafone.com;According to an answer from Vikash in another ticket [OS-42115] OSF | ACC2 | Wave 8.1 | CR716 Futurize regression defect | when booking KIP and TV the access details for TV are not displayed - Vodafone Global Jira
""It is hard to give an exact timing for this feature since it seems to have been implemented a long time ago. I recommend contact with Vodafone BA for more information.
Unity Media works exactly the same as normal Kable TV and KIP products to display the access details section."".
To me this is a direct conflict to the information that this ever worked in the (recent) past.
Without a specific version in which it worked before I have the feeling this discussing is not leading anywhere.

If we want to change this we need a requirement from Business regarding which tv technician options to align for unity or accept that the tv access details are not shown in unity cases.;;;","29/Sep/23 12:27 PM;nina.pickl@vodafone.com;Hi [~simon.auch@vodafone.com],

 ;;;","17/Oct/23 3:05 PM;simon.auch@vodafone.com;Hi Devi,

I have no clue what OSF is doing here, but definitely not how it should behave to the best of my knowledge.
I could reproduce the issue and make the following two screenshots:
!image-2023-10-17-11-31-41-319.png!
!image-2023-10-17-11-32-04-497.png!

Which shows that OSF thinks that 1V1/VP0/TECYESTV/TECNOTV should be selected. That is not correct since the last execution of the cable product logic up to that point in the checkout process returns none of these 4 products as visible.
For completeness I attached the log of the session up to the dropdown in the checkout: [^cable_rules_artifact_OS42066.log]

Please find out when the access details are shown in the checkout. All information until now seems to conflict with the unity case. Maybe there is a special handling for unity addresses hardcoded in OSF?;;;","19/Oct/23 11:57 AM;ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com;Hi [~simon.auch@vodafone.com]  

regarding ""All information until now seems to conflict with the unity case"" -> for CR716 we have raised also defects for VKD and not only for Unity, so something is in general wrong in this access details section.

As the latest observation happened after having new broadvision product catalogue in place, should we raise a defect against CR756? Or against Product catalogue?
I do not want to mix this defect here with behavior shown for broadvision products, otherwise will be even more confusing;;;","19/Oct/23 1:20 PM;simon.auch@vodafone.com;Hi Ariadne,
maybe it was not clear what I meant with ""All information until now seems to conflict with the unity case"":
 * We have multiple answers (in this ticket and in other tickets) saying that TECNOTV and TECYESTV control the display of the section (and did so in the past)

 * 
 ** this can't be the case for unity as those are not aligned products
 * In other answers it was mentioned that it is controlled not by TECNOTV and TECYESTV but by categories containing TECNOTV, TECYESTV, 1V1, VP0
 ** sound better, but also all of these products are not aligned and should never have been orderable for unity

In the newly encountered behaviour by Devi (https://jira.sp.vodafone.com/browse/OS-42066?focusedId=2974883&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels:comment-tabpanel#comment-2974883) suddenly the access details are shown. Even though TECNOTV , TECYESTV, VP0, and 1V1 are not bookable according to cable product logic?

Someone has to look into the OSE source code and check _systematically_ when this section is shown. I expect there to be _something_ hardcoded for VFW, but I cannot check that myself.

Without an explanation from OSE side when this section is shown I don't know how else to help with this defect. If it is supposed to be based on the orderability of specific categories {_}then the new behaviour is a OSE contradicts it because no product from that category is orderable in the scenario clicked by me{_}. So for starters this could be analysed and maybe we get some insight which logic we are missing from OSE.

As 7.2 testing itself is not started it is not correct to raise a defect on 7.2.so we are marked it as resolved.Please reopen it when if needed after you tested in 7.2 build. ;;;","16/Nov/22 1:57 PM;ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com;Hi [~bhagyashri.sorate@vodafone.com]  it is regular process to move defects from one wave to the next wave in case they are not ready in time. Also, if we identify new issues which are not critical and do not need to be fixed in a production fix delivery (as this is too risky also) they have to be fixed with the next possible release.

Not sure why you want to reject all tickets for Wave 7.2

They are raised to make sure you include the fix in the initial delivery for Wave 7.2 already 

If you confirm this is fixed with initial Wave 7.2 delivery we are going to retest after this delivery is in place in December and then we close it
