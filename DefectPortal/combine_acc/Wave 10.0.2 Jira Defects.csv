Hi Pallavi,

Kindly check if the Cable rules artifact file version is correct. If PCAT across other ACC1/ACC2 are same as ACC3 then we can try using the Cable rules artifact file from other ACC1/2 env.

By when issue started? and do we have any Cable artifact change after that issue started?

GLS discontinued its GLSIDENT service some time ago (months ago). For security reasons, we didn't immediately deactivate it in Prod, but instead made it ""unselectable"" via PriceRange adjustments. It was finally deactivated now (in Prod and Test). Unfortunately, the PriceRange in Test hadn't been adjusted at the time, so since yesterday, the old service for items up to €600 hasn't been available, only new services. We've now corrected the PriceRange in Test as well, and an old service is being returned via the GASO.;;;",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The investigation is ongoing, and we will provide further updates.;;;","26/Sep/25 12:17 PM;krishnkumar.satpute@vodafone.com;As discussed in Chat,

 

we need to clear the entries from ogw_search_criteria table 

Before proceeding with the deletion of entries where omnius_order_id starts with '480', we’d like to highlight a few critical implications to ensure informed decision-making:
 # The ACC team should acknowledge and take ownership of any downstream issues that may arise due to the removal of older order data. These orders may still be referenced in legacy/active orders.
 # If the data for this orders still exists in related tables like jesi_wf_amdocs_subscribe or Cassandra, and the same sequence is reused later, it could trigger a unique constraint violation. ** Please ensure the data is cleaned up across all relevant tables before proceeding.
 # Please take a count of entries from the table before running the delete query.
You can use the query ""DELETE FROM ogw_search_criteria WHERE omnius_order_id LIKE '480%';

 

only after [~rohan.kumbhar@vodafone.com]  confirms above impact. [~affan.baragazi@vodafone.com] will handle the deletion.

Hi Maheedhar,

 

When system trigger the ValidateAddress service request with value * mean a wildcard input to backend to result back to Omnius with possible Address list value response.

This issue seems to be related to the PST bug: [[PSTBUG-3509] PAPI | OSF | VKD,VFW | All orders are failing with Delivery & Billing address error message - DE Jira|https://de.jira.agile.vodafone.com/browse/PSTBUG-3509]

Answer from developer:

Hello,
The issue is in IBP (IRIS) when it contacts AdsFacade to validate the sent addresses. The exact field causing the issue is houseNumberAddition. When the field is omitted in the request, AdsFacade returns an asterisk in the candidate addresses. When the address is compared with the candidate address returned from AdsFacade, the validation fails (becasue null != '*'). 
A workaround can be applied in IRIS to ignore asterisks in both the address and the candidate address when comparing them as it's already a wildcard.

Hi Revanasiddha/Atharva,
h3.  
Based on further analysis it is identified that we are importing the PCAT Stack version files in to the databases similar to other raw pcat files. As part of publish the table _*catalog_import_log*_ is also got copied to application databases as part of publish from Sandbox DB as like other PCAT DB tables.

So which an expected behavior. In case any change expected then it has to be handled via enhancement.;;;","02/Sep/25 6:17 PM;revanasiddha.revanasiddha@vodafone.com;Hello All,

i can see from agent status table info both these agents have last logged in before couple of months the season we are getting this msg access blocked is due to threshold value from BO you can verify from acc BO

!image-2025-09-02-14-58-27-873.png!

 

in actual we should get this msg 

!image-2025-09-02-15-03-45-614.png!

I suspect the reason is in agent table reasonsuspensionid value is Array

!image-2025-09-02-15-08-39-472.png!

need to find out why this is setting to array please help to get below data:

from BO / UM created?

As discussed with Shrikrishna, we currently do not have the required access for this agent configuration. We have therefore requested with the IXc team (Sneha) to assist with the necessary details.

Regarding the issue, we are facing challenges with users that were created earlier (OLD) either via NGUM or manually.;;;","03/Sep/25 12:39 PM;ashutosh.chavan@vodafone.com;Hello [~bharath.krishnamurthy@vodafone.com] 

As requested, Sneha has provided the BO System Configuration details for analysis. Following this, Shrikrushna identified that the access block was caused by the threshold value set to 42 days.
To resolve the issue, we already attempted to unblock the user from the back office by performing actions such as unlocking the account and resetting the password. However, the issue remains unresolved.
Shrikrushna needs to investigate further to determine how we can successfully unblock these user accounts.;;;","12/Sep/25 10:38 AM;bharath.krishnamurthy@vodafone.com;[~ashutosh.chavan@vodafone.com] [~yogesh.borade1@vodafone.com]

Hi [~pallavi.kokate1@vodafone.com], [~puranik.shailesh@vodafone.com] 

The request which is coming to SOI is triggered from OSF. 

In the given trace id, I can see that OSF is not sending the ""AddressID"": ""151xxxx"" for billing address (in shopping cart), which is why the flow is failing.

Please check this with front end teams.;;;","22/Aug/25 11:52 AM;gaurav.lanjewar1@vodafone.com;Hi [~bharath.krishnamurthy@vodafone.com] kindly share your input for this issue.;;;","22/Aug/25 1:38 PM;shival.gupta1@vodafone.com;Hi [~tanvi.bagade@vodafone.com] [~gaurav.lanjewar1@vodafone.com] 

In the attached logs for Submit Order {*}477649{*}, ""AddressID"" for Billing address is populated (see the snapshot attached). Could you please provide more details whether the correct order logs are attached in the ticket or which field is expected by SOI.

Hi [~pallavi.kokate1@vodafone.com] ,

Based on description I can see no fulfillment logs generated means something is stuck within OSE looks while processing fulfilment xml.

Kindly arrange call as we can recreate scenario.

As a part of the CR888 , consentVerificationStatus was added . But now removed due to above defect(its not acceptable at KIAS end). Fix is impacting DSL and KIAS.
With mutual discussion with business,(we agreed to absorb the efforts and CR was not raised)
As the change is impacting both KIAS and DSL it is recommended to test at least 1 scenario each ( for DSL and KIAS).And we as OGW cant suggest what else should be covered as a part of testing here as we have no insight about implementation on kias and DSL side ;;;","24/Jul/25 6:20 PM;ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com;Ok so we assume we need to test DSL and Mobile Telesales as well as Retail as part of this defect, I hope this is sufficient;;;","25/Jul/25 12:03 PM;affan.baragazi@vodafone.com;Hi [~ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com] ,

For the mentioned Omnius Order Id: 473533, Submit Order logs is populated with correct date format 2025-07-15 as expected.

 For OIL to OGW logs -
<DeliveryDate>
<ns3:Value sourceSystem=""ALL"">20250715</ns3:Value>
</DeliveryDate>

 OIL to OGW is sending as per interface specification. Same format is used for FixedNet/DSL and it was agreed during design that we have to use same format for FucsionC as well. We (OSE) do not provide json format , its OGW. This needs to be checked from OGW side.;;;","07/Jul/25 8:07 PM;florentina.popa@vodafone.com;If so, should it be assigned for analysis to someone from Amdocs?;;;","07/Jul/25 8:09 PM;pranjali.shetake@vodafone.com;Hi [~affan.baragazi@vodafone.com] ,

As per the SubmitOrder request received from Omnius, we are getting the deliveryDate as below:

                       <DeliveryDate>
                            <ns3:Value {*}sourceSystem=""ALL""{*}>20250715</ns3:Value>
                        </DeliveryDate>

In OGW xsd for SubmitOrder this field is defined as an array, hence we are forwarding the same while converting it into JSON request please refer below snippet from xsd:
            <xsd:element name=""DeliveryDate"" nillable=""true"" minOccurs=""0"" maxOccurs=""1"">
                <xsd:complexType>
                    <xsd:sequence>

                    </xsd:sequence>
                </xsd:complexType>

The implementation of *DeliveryDate* is similar to that of *DealerCode* which is in the request and accepted by SOI.;;;","08/Jul/25 3:55 PM;affan.baragazi@vodafone.com;This is as per the implemented design for OGW.;;;","08/Jul/25 4:49 PM;atharva.paskanthi@vodafone.com;Currently we are blocked by https://jira.sp.vodafone.com/browse/OS-74868, therefore cannot reproduce it, once it is resolved
