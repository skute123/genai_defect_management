we have discussed this defect together with Gaurab from Amdocs in one of the sessions, last week, in which we analysed E2E the expected behaviour and discussed some defects.

Also Waldemar and Michael Heller were involved.

 

1. What I miss in this error description is the EXACT activities, that the agent/tester has done.

my assumption is:  the agent has selected the unsharp sim swap (which is a possibility in Retail, that will disappear with the esim Push Epic, but is still available if the permission for insert sim_serial_number is set (I think)

so..  question:  did indeed the tester select the UNSHARP SIMSWAP?

 

Because:

IF Agent selects UNSHARP SIMSWAP, 

THEN SubmitOrder.SIMCARD = E (as it always was)

and... OGW is triggered to send the emails when SIMCARD =E

(so.. this is not correct)

 

AS AGREED WITH GAURAB :

Amdocs will change/improve the software:

OGW will not only check for SIMCARD = E,  but will also check whether the NEW_SIM_SERIAL_NUMBER is not populated.

only then the emails will be sent;;;","30/Dec/24 3:46 PM;ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com;[~akash.ubbu@vodafone.com]  [~ajay.bhavar@vodafone.com]  [~elena.fueger@vodafone.com]  can you comment on the question from Rob?

-> did indeed the tester select the UNSHARP SIMSWAP?

 

(set to ""in progress"" again - as per comment amdocs is working on a fix);;;","30/Dec/24 5:25 PM;ajay.yashwantbhavar@vodafone.com;-> did indeed the tester select the UNSHARP SIMSWAP?

Hello [~robert.goebbels@vodafone.com] In both cases, Email is getting triggered, As the parameter SIMSWAP reason is always handed over to OGW with the value VR (Unsharp) even if the agent has selected Sharp (VS) in front end.

Please find below screenshot from submit order request.

Summary: 
 * works as (wrongly) designed
 * Amdocs will fix this without the need of a Change Request
 ** OGW will not only check:  is SIMTYPE E, in order to trigger the emails, BUT also check if the SIMNumber is empty

 

Details:

RETAIL channel; blocking permissions set:
 * agent must therefore insert SIM number (instead of SIMTYPE) AND
 * agent has possiblity to select Sharp vs unsharp simswap 

Omnius sends in submit Order
 * SIMYPE E, because agent has selected unsharp SIMSWAP (not clear to me, but it looks like Omnius also sends SIMTYPE E, if the agent selected sharp SIMSWAP, if I understand the comments right). 
 * SIMSERIAL number (because Agent has inserted a (physical) SIMnumber 

OGW triggers 5910 and/or 5930 email although the agent has inserted a (physical)  sim number

 

Solution: Even if Omnius sends SIMTYPE E,  OGW must also check, if a SIMNumber is provided  in submitOrder.  if the simnumber is empty, only then trigger the emails 

-->  as aligned with Gaurab some weeks ago

We have identified a new gap in ESIMPush epic, at least for me it looks like a solution gap.

Following are the scenarios :
 # ShiptoStore
 # Telesales/Retail
 # VORAS sending us status [VORAS_FINAL_SUCCESS_SHIP_TO_STORE_HANDOUT] in StOrderStatus (after H/W is handed out), with OmniusOrderID as OGWSubOrderId .

 

Expectation and issue:

 
 # OGW will identify the OGWOrderID using the OmniusOrderID and then subsequently the Subcriber Information to perform the ESIMPush procedure [ GeteSIMInfo + MaintainEID] .
 # Currently this is failing as in the request we don’t have OrderLineID , hence OGW doesn’t know which OrderLine to pick for subscriber information [it will be trickier if more than one OrerLineID associated with the order] to fetch the Subscriber Info to progress further.

 

Please note: VORAS doesn’t have OrderLineID in talesales scenario.

 

We need to discuss together to close the gap.

The svas service crashed several times over the whole day.

First we thought, it was the patched version of svas regarding the thumb-nail issue, but at the end this was not the reason.

Even using the original version that is running on these systems over years, did not change the crash rate.

Since midnight today, there are no further crashes of the svas service to see on PR.

The only thing, I changed was to remove a registry setting according to a ACL memory leak in Windows, that I son longer to be used under 2019 and later.

But this change was done in the morning and had no effect on the crashes.

We received this  EPSM-SOC-0406.xsd  file  in  OCA.000160779 /OC.000160773  (OPM_430.01.24.00)  and this is installed in PR Env as a part of OCA.


Let me clarify the issue here, Currently IT Env is with BSS44 and IT OPM is currently running with Soc version EPSM-SOC-0406.xsd.
In same way as per last OPM deployment [OCA.000160779 /OC.000160773  (OPM_430.01.24.00) ] on PR Env, the similar Soc version has been deployed EPSM-SOC-0406.xsd.

Now both IT and PR OPM is using the same soc version EPSM-SOC-0406.xsd, But from Soc side only IT Env having the latest version 0406.
PR Soc is still running on version 0405, So since the last deployment on PR OPM the incoming requests are using the latest version 0406 but from Soc side its still has the lower version.

That’s the reason the test cases are stuck at Oms-Warte-Antwort step in PR OPM.
To resolve this issue either PR OPM should be downgraded to version EPSM-SOC-0405.xsd or PR Soc version should be upgraded to 0406.

Due to this issue, VKD system is adding FIRMA as a salutation for this request in backend but When customer is activated in backend and agent tries to perform in-life sales flow on same customer, Omnius asking to select value for salutation field.

As discussed - Omnius is having only Mr & Mrs values for Cable SOHO customer in checkout & VKD backend is having only FIRMA value for salutation in backend for Legal customer.

i need some input regarding the handling of TV and KIP.
we are getting 2 order lines. 1 KIP, 2.TV
in the TV orderLine, all the products are EXISTING, meaning, we will not send them to KD backend.
so in that case, what will be the input to KD?
becasue currently in the code, if we have TV orderLine we need also to send tv array products;;;","03/Sep/24 4:17 PM;simon.auch@vodafone.com;[~ran.farjun1@vodafone.com] I don't understand your comment, but from the request log (attached: [^1114623_2dfd9e6b-2d44-4eb2-9cd7-d8c0d86de8cc_Request_19bd6b38-7d38-4bf8-93d9-1196ad7ee5e1.xml)] there is only one order line tv and one order line kip in the request if I am not mistaken?

Maybe you could also attach the request you are referring to?;;;","03/Sep/24 4:49 PM;ran.farjun1@vodafone.com;Hi Simon,
this is the request:
[^submit_wrong.xml]

i will try to explain again.
the second order line is TV, but there is no ADD or DROP ComponentActivityType in that order line, only EXISTING.

currently in the code if we have order line with tv we need to have also some ComponentActivityType as DROP or ADD.
because we didnt consider this could happened we are sending by mistake the KIP array inside the TV Array.

if i will fix it the TV Array now will be empty.
my question should we send it empty?

 ""serviceLineId"": ""TV"",
                ""products"": []

or we should sent this section at all?
this will be remove:

There was a discussion especially about ILS flows and the feedback from Business was:

At ILS there is no “nationality” field for DSL and cable orders, but there is for mobile. The mandatory field will then be empty in the future, meaning you will have to ask the customer again about his or her nationality.

 

Actually we also discussed if it should not be displayed for Mobile ILS, this was wrong from business perspective. But Thorsten Lehnert decided to not change anything, so Mobile is different than DSL/ Cable.

So from my point of view its not a defect as field is not expected for DSL and Cable ILS;;;",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

VKD is not calling order.controller -- > updateOrderProgress and then also not able to trigger “status.orderstatusservice” call which shall trigger On-Hold status and then calls towards fulfillment.

Hi Natasa,

 

The repairDb cron job setup is not done on ACC3 and is also not working on ACC2. This was causing the issue.

Fixed: The TID team executed the repairDb.php script on ACC3, which resolved the PCAT issue. This script needs to be executed with every PCAT publish.;;;","05/Sep/24 5:41 PM;natasa.dimovic1@vodafone.com;Retest on ACC3:

With the given correlation id (r76b2h98l6h54iurp7uhd9g9dc) I do find some requests in the logs, but none of them I believe is for NonStandardRates nor does any one of them contain an error.
There is one error in the rough timeframe though that is thrown by the spring framework itself though which suggests some kind of parsing error or similar, which is why I would be interested in the request itself.

The request should be a simple get request with two query parameters, one of which is relatively big.;;;","05/Aug/24 6:25 PM;rohan.kumbhar@vodafone.com;Checked with Cable team: issue still exists --may be due to PROD config issue.

If the issue is indeed that the wrong file is present (as observed multiple times on other environments)  the issue cannot be resolved by the portal solution as the import of the pcat is the responsibility of OSF.

When an agent has the AGENT_ROLE_PERMISSION_ENABLE_ESIMSERIALNUMBER permission, two div blocks with the same ID and name are rendered in the checkout new connection section for the SIM serial number.

Initial Behavior:

One div block (without SIM type selection) is loaded by default when the agent has the AGENT_ROLE_PERMISSION_ENABLE_ESIMSERIALNUMBER permission.
Another div block appears after the physical SIM selection.
Problem:

This issue arises in the case of PSIM hardware selection where the physical SIM type button is automatically selected, resulting in two input boxes with the same ID and name for the SIM serial number.
This duplication leads to an empty value being sent for the SIM serial number.
The issue is handled in JavaScript where we disable the ID and name of the div blocks depending on their visibility.
This ensures that only the visible div block’s input field is active, preventing duplicate IDs and names.

in prod its getting trigger at the same time
so in current scenario the publish event is getting trigger before recive event so setPermissions will be stuck on stand by.
also we can see that some of the setPermissions call are getting completed success, omnius order ids: 1097385, 1097395,1097391 ect...

as already discuss with prod team this fix might not solve 100% of the cases of setPermissions.
but, drastically reduce the occurrence of the standBy issue.
for permanent solutions we can discuss with Design team for new solution;;;","24/Jul/24 2:06 PM;ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com;Hi [~ran.farjun1@vodafone.com]  this means for some scenarios the reported issue in production will still happen but in general the situation should be improved?

i saw what Marco wrote. but it is the issue.

OGW is picking the status at the same time

!image-2024-07-21-10-52-51-438.png!

these 2 statuses working at the same time. 

in our case the completed success process is finishing 1 second before so you are seeing the push order status completed success first.

InProgress-FulfillmentStarted is finishing 1 second after the completed success, so you will see push order status  InProgress-FulfillmentStarted last.

 

 

!image-2024-07-21-10-56-55-623.png!;;;","22/Jul/24 7:40 PM;ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com;[~ran.farjun1@vodafone.com]  maybe you can detail the scenario bit more in context of CR553 (not the enhancement, but the solution which is already in place)

For every transaction considered for handling, OGW will search for the transactions by OrderID in the subscribe table.
 * If no other entries found, process the current transaction.
 * If +legacy+ timestamp (or its analogue – ts+sequence, like in KIAS) is populated:
 * If younger (by {+}*legacy timestamp*{+}) +processed+ entries found, the order of transactions was violated. SKY ticket should be opened, and the flow suspended until resolution.
 * Else if older (by {+}*legacy timestamp*{+}) +unprocessed+ entries found, pick the earliest unprocessed entry and handle it.

what is our expectation now in the context of this ticket.
The timestamp of the status is not exactly the same, but in between there are just miliseconds. 
So this is not covered by CR553 introducted in wave 7.x?;;;","22/Jul/24 7:54 PM;ran.farjun1@vodafone.com;the issue is that OGW will pick the correct sos from the db, but it will not stop there.

it will not wait until the entire process of InProgress-FulfillmentStarted is finished. 

so in that case InProgress-FulfillmentStarted has an advantage of a few miliseconds, but seems the flow of InProgress-FulfillmentStarted is a bit slower then completed-success.

so what happened is that completed-success is finishing a few miliseconds before and sending push order status.

after a few miliseconds inProgress-FulfillmentStarted is finishing and also send push order status, and because its the last one its reflecting in frontEnd;;;","22/Jul/24 9:49 PM;ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com;[~ran.farjun1@vodafone.com]  means its not about the picking, but about the runtime of the process?

if earlier status needs longer processing than latest status it will not work?

Is this correction part of CR553 enhancement? Or who needs to change something in the behavior? ;;;","23/Jul/24 11:21 AM;ran.farjun1@vodafone.com;sos for the same order need to be sent with a space of more then half a second.

i think even if we will get it with 2 or 3 seconds a part the process will be as expected.

 ;;;","23/Jul/24 12:04 PM;ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com;[~ran.farjun1@vodafone.com]  thanks for your quick feedback. Means as long as backend is not sending it with more space it will not work.

However, there is no way to control / delay the backend responses so we have to accept the behavior?;;;","23/Jul/24 12:18 PM;ran.farjun1@vodafone.com;right, if there is not a delay of a few seconds currently i dont think ogw can handle without some design change.
but, i think the Kafka solution in 9.1 can maybe help in this situation. ;;;","23/Jul/24 12:52 PM;ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com;[~ran.farjun1@vodafone.com]  CR553 enhancement was not scoped for Wave 9.1 release. I tried to clarify since more than 2 months but without any luck. Therefore its too late to take it as regular part of the release.

Means - it stays switched off like in Wave 9.0.
If there is enough time to include the test still in 9.1 (in case rest of sofware is working fine) we will decide to activate it later

[~alka.kshirsagar2@vodafone.com]  I assume to keep the defect for now on hold, as we will not have any solution at the moment.
We can check it again once CR553 enhancement might be activated but even then its not clear if it will work ;;;","28/Aug/24 4:03 PM;ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com;[~satish.dhere1@vodafone.com]  we deployed the delivery from Amdocs for CR553 enhancement to ACC1 Wave 9.1 . we can give it a try if this helped for this ticket but on ACC1 only;;;","28/Aug/24 7:04 PM;satish.dhere1@vodafone.com;Retest is in progress.

Currently there is simply no guarantee by the vkd systems that a InProgess-FulfillmentStarted update is sent if the order is already in a completed state.

Simplified flow on vkd side:
* there is a cron job that regularily requests the states of non completed orders from unity
* if there was a status change it sends the new state received by unity to osf
If the received order state from unity is completed vkd will sent the order state completed to OSF, no intermediate messages will be added.

This can usually only be observed in test environments as in production orders should be in a non completed state ""long enough"" in any backend.;;;","23/Jul/24 3:17 PM;elango.durairaj@vodafone.com;[~simon.auch@vodafone.com] *How much time was the order in the unity system in a non completed state?* – We don't have any fixed timeline for open state once order is triggered from OSF portal, But once order reached to Unitymedia RNS/Cablemaster then minimum order will stay open status 15 to 20 mits for work order closure, sometimes it will take longer time also depends on environment feasibility.  ;;;","23/Jul/24 4:05 PM;rohan.kumbhar@vodafone.com;As per Cable team

 This rule 'CRFN314: Standard premium Access defaulted' is getting false when returning back from the “Save Contract Summery” section. We suspect that the following expression is causing the issue.

cart.packageContainsInstalledBaseCategory('FN->FN_Package Configuration->Business Configuration->Options->Voice->Voice Access->Comfort Access') == true or cart.packageContainedInstalledBaseCategory('FN->FN_Package Configuration->Business Configuration->Options->Voice->Voice Access->Comfort Access') == true

We will investigate further and keep you updated shortly.

Hi guys,

are you sure, CRFN314 could cause the error ??

If you run the same test case like described above on ticket, the rule must return false, since there was/is no Preminum Access in the shopping cart all the time. Tester just processed the Basic Access for their purpose.;;;","12/Aug/24 3:55 PM;marco.abraham01@vodafone.com;Well, for all ILS orders either CRFN312 (if customer has basic access -> SKU C_basic) or CRFN314 (if customer has comfort access -> SKU C_comfort) has to be validated to true

 * We have changed the App Pool user to a local account for ACC2 server just to differentiate and check the domain user issue. Local user can not be set to second node due to permission issue.

Currently Arvind is working on it and he will share status once he got any update.;;;","23/Jul/24 12:07 PM;ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com;Checked with Arvind but nothing was fixed in this area.

Some proposed changes from Vendor have been done, but as this did not work, same have been reverted. Which means from OSF Side nothing was changed from beginning of this defect.

We observed, that situation is stable after Security patching  15.07.2024 20:30 to 16.07.2024 01:00 with overnight restart
-> Downtime activity of PULS patching to install latest WINDOWS OS patches / Install latest kernel (Linux,Solaris,HPUX & AIX) and to Install latest HPtool/VMwareTool.

Not sure if we should consider this as fixed then [~rohan.kumbhar@vodafone.com] ?

the first is ORDER_COMPLETED, so OGW will complete the order and push the status.

the second  is CUSTOMER_CREATED, according to mapping this is equal to InProgress-FulfillmentStarted.

so OGW will push that latest status it is getting from FN.

[~gaurav.lanjewar1@vodafone.com]  [~atharva.paskanthi@vodafone.com] fyi;;;","22/Jul/24 7:56 PM;tobias.pohlmann@vodafone.com;Hi [~vikash.saurav@vodafone.com] , thanks for the reply.

so, did you get that reply in the screenshot after following the steps in the ticket description? Because I am not seeing in that list any internet product yet, but maybe I am misunderstanding the purpose of that picture.

 

The desired behaviour is the following:
 * When any TV Connect is booked (for example, TCM) into the TV package, then the _precondition rules result_ will show that there are some products orderable with the property 'tags' containing '[omnius_technician_needed_no|https://smith.ui.cont.connect-vf.de/products?commit=master&flavour=prod&tagsContained=omnius_technician_needed_yes]' and some with the property 'tags' containing ['omnius_technician_needed_yes|https://smith.ui.cont.connect-vf.de/products?commit=master&flavour=prod&tagsContained=omnius_technician_needed_yes]'. Specifically, these will be 'TECNOKIP' and '1V1' or 'VP0'. But important are these tags that I just mentioned.
 ** Note that these products are _not_ put into the basket, but you need to check if they are _available_ .
 * On the checkout screen, this drop-down menu in the ticket description with the red frame should only be displayed when there is either a product orderable with the  tag '[omnius_technician_needed_no|https://smith.ui.cont.connect-vf.de/products?commit=master&flavour=prod&tagsContained=omnius_technician_needed_yes]' or 'omnius_technician_needed_yes'. If none of them is orderable, then the drop-down menu must not be displayed.
 * The same is true for internet products as well

The problem that needs to be fixed is:
 * When you follow the ticket description (first book TV, then book internet, then immediately go to the checkout), the drop-down menu _does_ appear, even though no product with the tag 'omnius_technician_needed_yes' is orderable.
 * From what we can gather, the problem seems to be that OSF decides if it wants to display the drop-down menu for TV when it is in the TV package, but not again later in the internet package (and vice versa).
 * So, what happens is:
 ** you book some TV Connect in the TV package ---> OSF checks for products with the tag 'omnius_technician_needed_yes/no', correctly finds that they are orderable, and stores the decision to display the drop-down menu for TV later in the checkout
 ** then you go to the internet package and select some internet tariff ----> now, with both TV _and_ KIP selected, no products with the tag are available anymore, and OSF correctly concludes to not show the drop-down menu for KIP later in the checkout. {+}But it does not update the stored decision for TV{+}, and will still display it later on.
 * -> What we need to be fixed is that OSF updates this _show-drop-down-menu-or-not_ decision both for TV and internet every time the rules are run, not only when the corresponing package – TV or internet – is currently open.

I hope this helps with what to look for.

Hi, Ariadne,

{*}{color:#de350b}yes, I can confirm that in any case where we book KIP + TV (no matter if Broadvision or not, no matter which order we book it in), no technician section should be shown{color}{*}. 

The reason why this fails is as I tried to point out in my comment below. It really is pretty confusing, I apologize for that. I had a call with Natasa where I explained the problem, because it really is a bit hard to grasp.

So again in case of Broadvision what happens is:
 - [In the KIP package] KIP is booked, TV Connect is added because of Broadvision ---> OSF understands that no section for KIP should be shown because KIP + TV is booked and remembers that

 - [In the TV package] TV Digital is booked ---> OSF understands that no section for TV should be shown because KIP+TV is booked

==> no KIP or TV technician section is shown

In case of Not-Broadvision:
 - [In the KIP package] Only KIP is booked, but not TV yet ----> OSF supposes that a technician section should be shown for KIP (because only KIP is booked) and remembers that
 - [In the TV package] TV Digital + TV Connect is booked ----> OSF understands that no section for TV should be shown because KIP+TV is booked, but doesn't update the reasoning for KIP

==> technician section is shown for KIP, but not for TV;;;","10/Jul/24 8:34 PM;tobias.pohlmann@vodafone.com;Hi guys,

so, yesterday, we were asked by [~timo.russo@vodafone.com] to change the behaviour for KIP-only bookings, too; [[PSTBUG-2380] OSF_One Sehberetischaft option is available on NE3, NE4 VVO and MNV addresses in OSF while booking KIP only for new customers - DE Jira (vodafone.com).|https://de.jira.agile.vodafone.com/browse/PSTBUG-2380]

With this change (product setup version V2390_2024_07_00_086), this symptom here will not occur anymore, so I guess we could close this ticket. I apologize for the confusion.

But the underlying bug – OSF doesn't update the technician options it will display for KIP when it is currently in the TV package – still needs to be fixed as it is also the cause for https://jira.sp.vodafone.com/browse/OS-58440 .;;;","15/Jul/24 12:36 PM;ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com;[~tobias.pohlmann@vodafone.com]  so means we should keep ticket OS-58435 on hold until it got fixed by PSTBUG-2380 and assign it to you instead of TechM?;;;","15/Jul/24 1:25 PM;tobias.pohlmann@vodafone.com;Yes, we can do that.

This issue is fixed in product_setup V2390_2024_07_00_086 for *self-install* addresses. But not yet for *not-self-install* addresses. Since this is a bit more involved we will do this with a different requirement that  [~timo.russo@vodafone.com] is currently writing but which is not quite here yet. 
So, this might come in PI-31 (not the upcoming one, but the one after).

I'd suggest to keep this open and assigned to me for now.;;;","18/Jul/24 2:22 PM;ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com;Thanks Tobias, please inform us when we can retest for not-Self-Install adress;;;","08/Aug/24 12:52 PM;natasa.dimovic1@vodafone.com;Hi [~tobias.pohlmann@vodafone.com] any update?

It is a candidate for the upcoming PI 24-31, which will start in the second half of September.

 Ah yes, you are correct.
We didn't do anything yet, but since OSF in the mean time fixed this bug:

this here is also solved. 

So, we can close this now. Thanks for bringing my attention back to this.

Sorry, I am uncertain: may I just close this, or does anyone with more authority need to do that?

Because, I just re-checked that bug (OS-58440) which was re-tested and marked as solved according to the comments, but when testing it now on ACC1 I still have the old problem, too. So, if I first book TV and then KIP and then go to checkout, then the technician option for TV is displayed.

Not sure if it came back somehow (or I am just confused right now), but I think once OS-58440 is fixed, OS-58435 should be fixed as well. And for me it looks like, both bugs are still present on ACC1.;;;","19/Oct/24 1:30 PM;natasa.dimovic1@vodafone.com;[~tobias.pohlmann@vodafone.com] you were right.

We will remove this feature that is incorrectly calculated by OSF in the scope of [[PORPDT-536] VKD Removal of Ready-to-Watch (Sehbereitschaft) Section - Part II (770375) - DE Jira|https://de.jira.agile.vodafone.com/browse/PORPDT-536]  anyway, so maybe it is not worth it to push OSF to do it, even though it is clearly still faulty Omnius-behaviour.

We are now not displaying the technician section when booking KIP only or KIP+TV.

For this reason, the technician state cannot leak from KIP to TV anymore (or rather, it will leak over, but it doesn't matter anymore).

Could you please re-test and confirm?;;;","30/Jan/25 6:22 PM;tobias.pohlmann@vodafone.com;The root problem persists – the KIP technician state is not updated when changes in the TV package are made. However, the business case changed on cable side with PORPDT-536, so that now, both for KIP-only customer as well as TV+KIP customer we do not want to show any section.

i dont think we need to send both of them in the same request.

 ;;;","09/Jul/24 6:41 PM;vishal.raut@vodafone.com;Hi all,

FYI as discussed in call, 
All the required data (OIL Logs, OSE logs, Lumen logs) has been shared with Waseem for further investigation.

Waseem will check and Sandeep will update for further action that needs to be done. ;;;","10/Jul/24 5:09 PM;gauri.bhagat@vodafone.com;Below are some of the findings after the call with Waseem,

It has impact ONLY IF all three switches are Yes If anyone of them is No then there is no impact. We have checked in PROD all three switches are set to 'No' So ACC team cannot decide for PROD, decision has to take by Fusion C team if they want Switches Yes. ;;;","10/Jul/24 6:57 PM;sandeepkumar.pradhan@vodafone.com;Hi All,

{*}Why issue Occurred{*}: Since all the 3 field for CustomerDataHUB Solution1 Settings and CustomerDataHUB Settings  such as

CustomerDataHUB Solution1 Settings 
1)Central Search ES Interfaces Enabled

CustomerDataHUB Settings
1)Legacy search and MRT Enabled
2)Enable CDH Interface
are set to ""Yes"" which breaks the API flow in current OSE build  which is not the case in ACC1 or PROD
in both these environment at least one of the them or all are set as ""NO"" where both customer search and Installed base working fine (for PRODUCTION all filed set as NO)


{*}Action plan{*}: we need to work with Vodafone design team to understand on what criteria these all filed need to switch on (Set as yes) after that or parallelly we need look from OSE prospective how we can handle these API irrespective of setting (all 3 set to YES or all 3 set to NO(working condition) or partial set of YES and NO (working condition))
 

Also PROD and ACC2 are almost equal we should ensure that ACC2 setting always same that of PROD else conf change leads to issue like this , Do understand that tACC2 setting can be change too for testing but it has to be known to an extent;;;","11/Jul/24 12:02 PM;ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com;[~sandeepkumar.pradhan@vodafone.com]  the settings on ACC and in PROD will never be exactly same, as we are always testing future topics in ACC which might not be live yet.
However, for these Fusion C switches we had topics in scope for different releases, so the functionality itself is live since a long time but with a technical go live.

1)[OS-8975] SOL0 - Search & display customer with product(s) mastered in solstice - Vodafone Global Jira -> implemented with Wave 7.0, tested with Wave 7.1  

2) [OS-11283] SOL1SE32 - Extending the OSF Search for Solstice Customers - Vodafone Global Jira -> initially implemented with Wave 7.2, because of needed enhancement tested again with Wave 9.0 

We are not having any new functionality, the switches are there since years. 
To retest your TechM fix for OS-56961 of course all switches had to be YES and in release Wave 9.0 they have been on YES in general most of the time, as OS-11283 was part of Wave 9.0 and tested by Fusion C team.

As ACC1 was used for Wave 8.2 of course ACC1 was different, as there only OS-8975 was live already (therefore only one switch was enabled) 

And as its technically live, Fusion C team can decide at any time to switch it ON in production. Its like any other technical go live, where functionaly is enabled in ACC but not yet in production.;;;","12/Jul/24 2:24 PM;ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com;Workaround: We have switched OFF SOL1 search for now, Fusion C team was informed about the situation and asked for solution / change

This can be either fixed by disabling the CDH sol1 search (elastic search) or increasing the threshold of displayed customers in the admin setting UI. fyi [~peter.nestvogel@vodafone.com];;;","22/Jul/24 4:56 PM;ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com;Internal TechM call with C1/Fusion is planned to discuss on further handling of this defect ;;;","12/Aug/24 8:31 PM;ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com;[~vikash.saurav@vodafone.com]  we need an update on this ticket to know how to handle the fusion C switch for extended search ;;;","22/Aug/24 4:03 PM;ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com;Talked to Vikas today, team wants to reproduce the issue on ACC2. Therefore we would need to activate the Fusion C search for some time, this needs to be aligned with [~gauri.bhagat@vodafone.com]  / [~ajay.bhavar@vodafone.com] ;;;","27/Aug/24 7:14 PM;akhilesh.sawarkar@vodafone.com;We attempted to replicate this in the ACC2 environment with Shweta and Sneha, and it appears that the CS API is functioning properly for both Fixed and Cable with all CDH interfaces enabled (which means all three switches are set to 'Yes'). We are able to search for customers using the GUI as well as the CS API.

Please see the attached evidence[^Defect_OS-58345_evidence.docx]

Hi All.

We delivered a debug patch for this issue to ACC1 on 17/12 under the reference CN#KIAS2000_CN_18936 however that debug patch didn’t help much to fix the issue and also didn’t indicate reason for failed again so we are validating further more on it, Soon we will update the action plan and that action plan include is to validate with API expert to Fastrack this issue resolution.,;;;","20/Dec/24 2:12 PM;daniel.loos@vodafone.com;regarding this specific error message, please be aware that enabling the extended search will also enable this unrelated setting in the default configuration:
 !screenshot-1.png|thumbnail! ;;;","29/Dec/24 7:28 PM;ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com;Debug patch CN_18955 was deployed on 27th of December and search was activated, waiting for feedback from TechM on next steps;;;","30/Dec/24 3:34 PM;sandeepkumar.pradhan@vodafone.com;We added extra logs on 27-dec under debug patch CN_18955 and after reviewing them, I identified an issue with the Fixed customer that needs to be handled. Also, for the cable customers, the response structure is also incorrect.

As we mentioned, it seems that the issue is with the response structure after enabling the third switch, which is causing the 500 errors.

 We now have the required details and will work on fixes. Once the changes are done, we will provide another patch to verify the same shortly.;;;","07/Jan/25 5:21 PM;atharva.paskanthi@vodafone.com;Hello [~vikash.saurav@vodafone.com], could you please check with Sandeep and update Delivery date for this ticket;;;","08/Jan/25 2:41 PM;ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com;Checked with Sandeep - Delivery to ACC1 can be 15th of January;;;","10/Jan/25 6:41 PM;gokul.vade@vodafone.com;Hi [~sandeepkumar.pradhan@vodafone.com]  if it is fixed and delivery will be on 15th Jan then please update the defect status to FIXED ;;;","16/Jan/25 5:26 PM;vikash.saurav@vodafone.com;CN KIAS2000_CN_18984   wave9.1.1  Full delivery for Acc1 and PROD

its not ogwOrderId and not Omnius order id;;;","01/Jul/24 4:35 PM;ran.farjun1@vodafone.com;Hi,

after the call today we can see that the flow is on standBy because no customer id is sent to ogw.
when customer id is being sent, OGW is triggering SetPermission request as expected;;;","01/Jul/24 7:04 PM;rohan.kumbhar@vodafone.com;

 !cable_minerva logs.png|thumbnail! 

Checked OSE/OGW calls where correct BEW update version with customer id is sent at UM backend where in Cable logs we see the request getting sent to UM via Minerva asking to update Version 4-- but somehow it seems UM is not updating Version 4 at their end - PFA SS for reference
For detail analysis check we need UM team support to check for this issue;;;","02/Jul/24 3:14 PM;rohan.kumbhar@vodafone.com; !screenshot-1.png|thumbnail! 

Tried new order for BEW with below details --same issue that from backend OSF is not getting the correct updated version as 4 in getcustomer details due to which the button is enabled for Unity media flow
customer id:953464201
documentID: 10875779;;;","03/Jul/24 12:53 AM;rohan.kumbhar@vodafone.com;here we see issue from Minerva adapter -- email sent to UM team to check on this issue 
;;;","04/Jul/24 6:28 PM;rohan.kumbhar@vodafone.com;As per the latest call on BEW topic.. there is a design GAP for the BEW flows which needs to be discussed by VF Design team.
as of now the problem here for this flow is that in the GetCustomerDetails Mode 3 call Omnius is always receiving BEWVersion as ""0"" irrespective of any other version is sent from OSF. So there is no checks nor validation of this BEW version at legacy backend and everytime Cable/UM will send Version 0 only.
So this is a design gap and currently this defect needs to be kept ON_HOLD until further clarification;;;","09/Jul/24 3:00 PM;ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com;[~rohan.kumbhar@vodafone.com]  who is taking this point now to discuss about unitymedia?
As its not only BEW only Retail which is not wroking, but also not for Telesales new customers in case its not IPCC triggered, and Retail new customers have never been tested.

So a general discussion is required?;;;","11/Jul/24 7:56 PM;ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com;[~rohan.kumbhar@vodafone.com]  based on the latest calls e have the following findings for Retail BEW and unitymedia in general

1) New customer, Retail, order + BEW -> Backend receives and stores BEW correctly

2) Existing customer, Retail, order + BEW -> Backend receives and stores BEW correctly

3) Existing customer, Retail, BEW only ->{color:#de350b} *Backend receives and stores BEW correctly? Please confirm this*
{color:#172b4d}What is wrong in all cases -> Frontend OSF is not able to retrieve the right BEW settings. So if BEW was updated in UNitymedia backend, Frontend is not reflecting this. It still looks like no BEW is set{color} ** 
{color:#172b4d}We will also compare the same for VKD, how Retrievecustomerinfo Mode 3 related to BEW permissions is looking like{color}{color};;;","12/Jul/24 3:20 PM;rohan.kumbhar@vodafone.com;As per latest observation it seems that Problem is happening only for the Unity Media customers when they chose BEW Options.
We tried 1 Cable New acquisition where BEW were correctly updated at backend and then we tried to fetch the same customer on OSF portal where correct Version status was reflected in GetCustomerDetails call and also BEW Button was disabled.

;;;","12/Jul/24 7:08 PM;ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com;[~rohan.kumbhar@vodafone.com]  the ticket itself is only for Unitymedia, so for VKD its not a problem and no ticket reported.

We still need to document here, if the Existing customer, Retail, BEW only for Unitymedia is reaching the backend as ticket says 

_*{color:#de350b}BEW version is not updating in Unity Backend{color}* and BEW Erfassen is enable even after update the version._

 

At the moment we assume, BEW version is getting updated in Unity backend, but we cannot retrieve the GetPermissions because its not giving back the correct version 
Unitymedia is handling permissions with Version 2, OGW expecting Version  4 and for retrieval of existing permissions we get Version 0.

Needs to be checked with responsible person from MinervaAdapter (VKD side);;;","17/Jul/24 2:34 PM;ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com;No progress yet as we did not identify the responsible person who can help with Minerva Adapter VKD ;;;","18/Jul/24 9:28 PM;ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com;I have enclosed the latest discussion.
As per latest analysis this problem is related to the way back from Unitymedia via Minerva Adapter VKD to OGW

{color:#de350b}*OK:*{color} OGW version 4 -> Minerva Adapter maps Version 4 from the VKD request into Version 2 for the request to UME/VFW -> UME/VFW is storing Version 2 correctly in Mood and showing right entries in RNS for the customer 

{color:#00875a}*Not OK*{color}: Now when we open the customer who has given BEW again in OSF, we expect that the stored BEW is taken and we are not asked to capture BEW again. Problem: For this get_permission Call we are receiving version 0 for the mentioned scenarios and we cannot map this version to our valid Version 4 (not OK)

{+}*Gap*{+}: We need a Mapping: UME/VFW is sending back Version 2 to Minerva Adapter-> Minerva Adapter maps Version 2 to Version 4 if getpermission request is coming from OGW

 

I have shared the feedback also with Jörg Trierweiler, Thomas Schneider, Andreas Baldermann and few more people to verify.
This is a general topic and not specifically related to BEW only Retail Epic
Waiting for feedback about possible next steps;;;","11/Aug/24 5:06 PM;ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com;I did not receive an answer yet from the experts how to handle this defect. However, I remind them again (Due to vacation might need some time until they reply).

OGW-->OneDMS Will call: In Progress Doc-Archiving(internally it will call FastSearch/Save Document

There is no guarantee by cable systems to always provide a order fulfilment started before a order completed success event.
In production this shouldn't be an issue, because orders usually take a while to be completed, in the test systems however testers might mark them as finished very fast.

There was a parallel issue as well with minerva/cama which prevented minervaadapter to retrieve any order states which _should_ be resolved now.

3) proceed to checkout and generate documents

4) submit the order

5) check for the sky ticket and conclude with either Success resume or Continue with Next Step

Actual Result:

Currently as per the understanding orders not getting handled properly if Esim is selecting in the flow and results in not getting Marsh file

This above ILS order was handled by Sky ticket and we performed Resume success and we were able to see the Marsh record  !https://statics.teams.cdn.office.net/evergreen-assets/personal-expressions/v2/assets/emoticons/smile/default/30_f.png?v=v82|width=20!  So we can say we are good with the Sky ticket flow 

 

!Z!

 

 

with todays observations we have only 2 issues as Ran mentioned
 # subscriber was not updated correctly in cdm
 # some case in telesales we are not triggering marsh flow

 

Hence am changing the defect topic and details accordingly but still its unclear what exactly is the flow where we see the order status are not getting triggered properly in OGW for generating the Marsh file.

 

But as per yesterdays discussion for some of the cases in telesales OGW is not handling the internal flow and completed success is not getting properly which results in not generating the Marsh file.

Assumption is if the case is with Esim

           orderLineIncludesHardware = false

            multiSIMADDExists = true and multiSIMADDOnlyESimExists = true.

[~pallavi.kokate1@vodafone.com] 
 
 
Blocking permissions were created to revert back to the previous feature before 9.0 implementation since D2COC was not there before 9.0 the SIM selection would be as it was for ACQ flow per channel (Retail or Telesales);;;","26/Jun/24 8:11 PM;ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com;[~vikash.saurav@vodafone.com]  so you mean that we can only go live with both of the topics at the same time and not decide to go live with D2COC but not yet with eSIM Push part 1?

Both topics are independant in project planning - when to use in production. ;;;","27/Jun/24 11:45 AM;vikash.saurav@vodafone.com;Shruti Kanchan added a comment -
 
 
[~ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com]  - it simply means with the blocking permission the SIM selection option will be as BAU before 9.0 we definitely can go live with both epics.

 ;;;","27/Jun/24 2:39 PM;pallavi.kokate1@vodafone.com;Had a call with Vikash and Divya from TechM but finding are this  is working as expected 

1) D2COC scenario is not like MIGCOC,in MIGCOC we have always keep existing sim option 

2)if we need to keep existing sim card in D2COC then Enable sim seialnumber permission should be assign to

3)It will implement in E-sim push (part-2) default selection 

[OS-50892] BUSINESS: As a sales agent I want to get the same eSIM&pSIM defaulting options for D2C with owner change scenario like for standard D2C scenario - Vodafone Global Jira

3)As of now it if blocking permission is not assigned it will behave like new activation only;;;","01/Jul/24 8:11 PM;pallavi.kokate1@vodafone.com;As per Discussion with Robbert,We never required or designed a use-case (regardless of permissions) that a customer cannot keep his existing SIMcard.

(In general we only designed DEFAULT settings for new vs keep SIM, so if an agent cannot select ""keep existing SIM""  then this cannot be implemented in our Epic

 ;;;","19/Jun/24 8:04 PM;ran.farjun1@vodafone.com;OGW is checking if the oneDMS response we are getting these 2 docs: *72001 and 72004.*

but not only that, im also checking the id: 2066, 2115.

like so *72001 and 2066.  72004 and 2115.*

its for every  *telesales order and every stack.*

so again if there is no match with OGW checks the save doc will not be trigger.

i just need conformation of which value to check. is it *2115 or* {*}2066{*}{*}{*};;;","20/Jun/24 12:53 PM;satish.dhere1@vodafone.com;Hello All,

We have observed that, saveDocumentRequest is not triggered for all stack new activation order flow. and for *All stack ILS flow customer id is available in fastFast Search Output.*;;;","20/Jun/24 9:30 PM;ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com;FYI we have checked potential fix on ACC2 today, [~rohan.kumbhar@vodafone.com]  will update with some more details.

Issue is caused by [FAST-741] CR759 - OGW: As a system I want to enrich the metadata of contract summary & CS-template document in OneDMS in the telesales channel and handle UM customers correctly - Vodafone Global Jira

 

two patches will be send tomorrow, so we can decide about production deployment (Matthias Breuer)

Its not fixing CR759 but removing some of the implementation to make it work again. CR759 needs redesign. ;;;","21/Jun/24 1:59 PM;deepak.garg1@vodafone.com;Fixed in CN_18548;;;","24/Jun/24 6:34 PM;satish.dhere1@vodafone.com;Hello All,

We have observed that issue has been resolved now .

Hence closing defect .

*Steps to Reproduce:*
 
1. Login to Omnius as Retail/Telesales channel.
2. Search existing Mobile customer which is eligible for Prolongation.
3. Add E-SIM compatible Hardware and Proceed to checkout.
4. Select E-SIM in New connection section.
5. Submit order and verify SendDocumentRequest is generated after the prolongation flow completed from KIAS.
 
*Actual:* OGW is sending Activation code value without prefix in SendDocumentRequest for 5930 email.
 
*Expected:*  # OGW needs to call GeteSimInformation API as described in OS-49735 to fetch the relevant information to use in SendDocument API.
 * 
 ** *Special handling for ActivationCode* - LPA+:+$(ActivationCode) , we need to add a prefix as ""LPA:"" before the ActivationCode before sending it to OM.

Update:

For now these additionally old options and VOID restrictions are required and related to the UAT phase.

In a few days we will get the final PCAT version on ACC2, where the old cover plus options will not longer be visable and all VOIDs will see:

the new 5xVC(ohne Diebstahlschutz) & 5xVCP options(mit Diebstahlschutz).

Current result::
On ACC2 environment the multimapper entries with basketAction CHANGE are not triggered any longer whereas the same is still working on the ACC1

Expected result:
We need a clear statement which basket actions can be used for mutually exclusive category or subpackage with a cardinality 1..1

 

Discussion via email:

Hi Rahul,

 

as just discussed in the call:

Was there any change in the last time on Omnius side concerning the basket action change?

Because we have a different behaviour on ACC1 (Wave 9.0) and ACC2 (Wave 9.1)

 

I used the same customer and performed the same tariff change (which includes a change from accessTechnology IP Bitstream to L2-BSA VDSL)

 

But however on the ACC1 a multimapper rule is triggered, but on ACC2 not.

 

I’m talking about this one

Find the whole submit Order for both environment attached.

For me it looks like that the interpretation of the skuaction is now differently.

 

Please check this with priority as most of the orders currently failing (and will fail in production)

We do not need a software fix for this ticket 

1) Wrong behavior for VC options is caused by PCAT Setting see defect [OS-57642] OSF | ACC2 | Wave 9.0 | CR791 | Component type ""HIS"" is missing in submit order request for Vodafone Cover Insurance product. - Vodafone Global Jira
2) For CR650 VCP Options its working fine
3) For old legacy handset/Tablet Insurance options it was not working - thats what this ticket here is also about, BUT for these options there is no marsh file at all. As the marsh file needs IMEI which is not there for these old options. Initially we wanted to fix this part with this defect, but as we came to know its expected behavior the fix was rejected from us

[~taher.golvala@vodafone.com]  so now we have to close this ticket and only follow up with OS-57642 right?;;;","24/Jun/24 1:58 PM;krishnkumar.satpute@vodafone.com;Hello team

yes, we have a fix for Document Type is 5930_eSimCredentials. you can check the fix in this defect:

but the problem here is that this customer is SOHO, and in the submit request we dont have this info:

Browser: microsoft edge
Environment: ACC2
Channel: Telesales + Retail

Steps to reproduce the issue:
 - Enter customer 931951572 (existing customer VKD with homebox2 in inventory makes device change without tariff change)
 - ILS Flow ""Paket ändern""
 - Select existing package: ""Kabel Internet & Phone"" to see the available options
 - Select option : ""[OHH]Option HomeBox (Fritz!Box 6670) 5,99€""
 - Check shopping cart and move to checkout -> see in extended shopping cart that there is no monthly fee of 5,00 Euro for Servicepauschale, its just a one time fee
 - Fill all relevant details in checkout section and move to Contract Summary creation page
 - create and open Contract Summary

ID: 10486670 Stand: 07.06.2024

Current result: Position ""Servicepauschale Gerätetausch 5€/month"" is displayed on the Contract Summary in section ""Monatliche Zahlungen""

!image-2024-06-07-14-37-03-841.png!

Expected result: Position ""Servicepauschale Gerätetausch 5€/month"" is NOT displayed on the Contract Summary in section ""Monatliche Zahlungen"".

Shopping cart is correct and not showing any Servicepauschale with a monthly price

Cable Weborder which is transfered to backend is also looking fine.
We compared with different portal ECC and here also CS is working fine, so its only a problem with OSF orders

Hi All ,
 
Based on further analysis come to know that the problematic product _*Servicepauschale Gerätetausch (neu) 5,00*_ is not sent as part of ProcessOrder or SubmitOrder xml and is not part of cart or order overview as well.

Also the pdf file shared where we see problematic product is generated by OM by using the information shared from OGW.

So further this can be investigated on OGW side on why and how we get this product.

 

Thanks;;;","27/Jun/24 2:45 PM;ran.farjun1@vodafone.com;Hi,

sorry but if OGW to check i need more information.
which tag to check from submit request?

Hi All,

As per reporter issue is that the PDF generated by Output Management(Refer PDF attached in ticket) is having wrong product which is {_}*Servicepauschale Gerätetausch (neu) with monthly charge 5,00*{_}. This is not suppose to present on the PDF. We checked on OSE Submit order logs(Generate ContractSumamry logs) and we didn’t find the problematic product data on SubmitOrder XML which is having monthly change of 5.00 Euro.

Issue we see only on PDF generated by OM not on SubmitOrder xml or OSE.

 

*Note:* Product with same name _*Servicepauschale Gerätetausch (neu)*_ having 29.99 Euro is expected in PDF but not the product with 5.00 Euro;;;","27/Jun/24 4:39 PM;ran.farjun1@vodafone.com;so again, if  its not from the request OGW to OM what OGW need to check?
is this defect need to be handle by OM?

 ;;;","27/Jun/24 9:00 PM;alka.kshirsagar2@vodafone.com;Hi [~ran.farjun1@vodafone.com] we have checked in sendDcumentRequest which is initiated by OGW, its sending *5.0* values from OGW request, 

we have also checked with OM development, they said its coming from OGW, hence its printing

 # OnlineUser_001:UpdateOnlineUserRegistrationStatus
 # OnlineUser_001:GetPartyForManagedBusinessObject

And above two services are not yet implemented in OGW/OSF, Therefore, OGW will map LegacyCustomerID as a BAN in WriteMemoRequest instead of BanPartyID.

I think so BanPartyID is not being used in ActivateSubscriberRequest input so it will not cause any issue even if OGW is sending same stub response to Omnius, [~ran.farjun1@vodafone.com]  Please confirm once from your side :);;;","06/Jun/24 11:30 AM;ran.farjun1@vodafone.com;Yes Ajay,

so im reverting my commit and i think you can close this defect;;;","06/Jun/24 11:46 AM;ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com;[~ajay.yashwantbhavar@vodafone.com]  just to have it understood completely. 
For our normal testing we do not need to enhance Mock? 
as in ticket OS-56745 its stated: BanPartyID is missing because AutoRegisterOnlineUser is not returning BanPartyID in response, after switching to AutoRegisterOnlineUser interface to real connection and now BanPartyID is received in generate contract response 

 

So if we return to Mock again, it will work for *all cases apart from Memo creation for D2COC* which needs to be fixed independently from our Mock? 

But for this use case we still need to enhance the Mock? To get PartyID back. ;;;","06/Jun/24 12:13 PM;ajay.yashwantbhavar@vodafone.com;Hi [~ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com] 
Yes correct, OGW needs to Map LegacyCustomerID which is coming in SubmitOrderRequest instead of BanPartyID and there is no impact for other scenario (other than D2C owner change), [~ran.farjun1@vodafone.com] Can you please check the use of BanPartyId in Input Request, if it was only applicable for WriteMemo Request, I will close this ticket.;;;","06/Jun/24 12:20 PM;ran.farjun1@vodafone.com;there are other uses for BanPartyID.

In today’s call, which took place at 16:00 CET,  the proposal from Thomas Wiesner was to *+block the BEW only scenario for customers with populated company name+* (Business Customers).

Thomas’s opinion is that the BEW update activity is not relevant for business customers.

from US:

       </ComponentList>
 ...
   </OrderLine>
</OrderLineList>
from submit request:

this is under: 

/ns2:ROOT/DATA[1]/OrderLineList[1]/OrderLine[1]/SystemAdditionalData[3]/AttributeCode[1]

 <SystemAdditionalData>
          <SystemName>FN</SystemName>

As discussed over meeting with Oren and Shruti, Omnius is expected to send the Ownership status value to OGW without umlaut letters as per the user story.

The PCAT issue has been already fixed and will be deployed tonight.;;;","12/Jun/24 5:49 PM;maheedhar.bekkem@vodafone.com;We have retested today for the path changes and shared observations as below.

[~natasa.dimovic1@vodafone.com]  the cable promo’s you are referring are goodies which are direct products, but for DSL its promotions means its part of a product vodafone secure Net+

you cannot choose this product(GS_SN_3x3_99[br]) individually it comes with vodafone secure Net+

hence the NEU comes to actual product not the promotion associated to it.

HI [~natasa.dimovic1@vodafone.com] 

Did some analysis on code level identified that as mention by Michael Friedrich there is no special handling for promos.

We show NEW tag for those products whose system action is 'add'(which means the products which are not added by Install base or dropped in cart) and sale type is one of these “RETBLU,RETNOBLU,RETTER,ILSBLU,ILSNOBLU”.

This is working as expected

[~gaurav.lanjewar1@vodafone.com] fyi;;;","05/Jul/24 4:41 PM;natasa.dimovic1@vodafone.com;[~michael.friedrich02@vodafone.com] could you please check the latest comment of [~vikash.saurav@vodafone.com]?

Than you;;;","05/Jul/24 4:53 PM;michael.friedrich02@vodafone.com;[~natasa.dimovic1@vodafone.com]  I understood you added the promo ""new"" through this transaction. So there is a plenty of stuff tagged with ""NEU""  - so in general it works.  But why doesn't have the discounts (GS_DSL_BOOST .... or GS_SN_3x3_99....) the NEU Tag then? (these are not coming from installed base - so why its missing?)

What Sunil wrote is exact what I expect, but doesnt work for those elements. Why?;;;","05/Jul/24 5:05 PM;natasa.dimovic1@vodafone.com;Hi [~vikash.saurav@vodafone.com] please answer to the comment of [~michael.friedrich02@vodafone.com] .

Hi [~natasa.dimovic1@vodafone.com]

So, kindly check this issue as OGW should not pass these fields to Tivano.

Also, is any confirmation received from Oren regarding this?;;;","06/Jun/24 6:31 PM;ran.farjun1@vodafone.com;Hi,

i checked an order from April (ogwOrderId: 2805398), i do see the same tags there:
<location-details>

            <tae-location>EFH</tae-location>
        </location-details>
        <desired-installation-date>2024-06-04</desired-installation-date>

*Oren Aharoni*;;;","11/Jun/24 12:39 PM;satish.dhere1@vodafone.com;Hi [Oren|mailto:oren.aharoni@amdocs.com] ,

 

Sure .

If I correctly understood the solution from you earlier email,

If we [OGW] receive value of SALES_PHASE attribute under ({*}Can we please have the exact location of the attribute ?{*} ) as (""Nachverdichtung"",""Vorvermarktung"") then OGW won’t send the fields (Installation-> location-details->tae-location *and* Installation-> desired-installation-date ) towards Tivano .

 

Do we need to consider any other parameters or scenario?

 

Also based on the previous mail it seems like this will be a new change request , please share the further details so that we can provide the QR and efforts for the same.

 

Thanks,

The issue is with 'postcode' parameter. This is causing the 500 error.

Hello [~sukhdev.singh@vodafone.com] ,

CDH API 026 is been called with wrong parameter *postCode* instead of *postcode* but the error thrown is 500 'Internal server error', which is not the case.
This happens because in trn table there is no code '016' for 400 (Bad Request) for API 026.

Is it fine with you if I add this new code in trn table ?

Hi [~constantin.ermurache@vodafone.com] ,

As you mentioned for adding the 400 Bad request to Trn table and using in error handling.

Its perfectly fine as we need this code for error handling on wrong parameter name.

Hi Ariadne It is working fine in ACC2 . So can we move this defect to ACC2 and close ? or do we need to keep it in ACC3 only ?
{quote}
we can move it to ACC2 and close it with retest on ACC2. 

 

the catalogue which we received on ACC3 mid of last week will not reach any test environment anymore so probably issue should not happen again

i check the monitor in JESI, seems the issue is the subscriber number is empty in the CDM of OGW.

we are getting the subscriber number for every orderLine but the problem is we are getting the set order status in the same second:

because of this the CDM is not getting update correctly and 1 of the orderLine missing the subscriber number, and if this is missing the Marsh file will not be created for that order line.

this is the timepStamp from the set order status:

While performing D2COC scenario we observed Yellow message banner with text 'Der Anschlusspreis von 39.99€ wurde wieder hinzugefügt' is not visible

*We observed activation fee 39.99€ instead of 39,99€ here we expecting comma instead of dot as 39,99€*

Text in yellow banner should be 'Der Anschlusspreis von 39,99€ wurde wieder hinzugefügt'

*Test data*: GSM1721751999

*Pre-requisite*: Agent has permission DEBIT_TO_CREDIT permission

*Reference Story*: https://jira.sp.vodafone.com/browse/OS-47282

*Steps to reproduce*:

*Configurator*:
1. Login to Retail Channel.
2. Select mobile package
3. Select hardware & Tariff
4. Fill necessary details.
5. Do check the D2COC check box
6. Enter debit MSISDN and click on validation button
7. The First Name and Last Name fields (3 in total) should be auto-filled with data once the validation is successfully completed by the OGW response
8. The memo radio buttons should allow selecting only one option at a time (standard radio button feature).
9. Subscriber activation Fees should be added back to the mobile postpaid activation package, if the D2C with owner change checkbox is unchecked. Meaning, the scenario is now a normal Postpaid ACQ
10. Omnius should show the banner/message to the Agent “Activation Fee <9.99> EUR was added to the shopping cart…”

*Actual result*: Now in yellow banner message activation fee is *39.99€ instead of 39,99€*

As discussed with ⁠Ran Farjun, 

BanPartyID is missing because AutoRegisterOnlineUser is not returning BanPartyID in response, after switching to AutoRegisterOnlineUser interface to real connection and now BanPartyID is received in generate contract response and also sent in fulfillment request towards OGW but now we are getting different error message which we discussed with ⁠Affan Baragazi, As per his analysis OGW is sending BAN ID as Party ID in WriteMemo Request and error needs to check from KIAS side.

 * Therefore, will reschedule the call according to availability of Oren to discuss further;;;","06/Jun/24 12:01 PM;atharva.paskanthi@vodafone.com;As discussed in call, 



- Currently OGW is sending, PartyID as BAN ID in WriteMemoRequest which is failing in KIAS with Ban don't exist error message as BanPartyID is not known to KIAS, Therefore OGW will map LegacyCustomerID as a BAN in WriteMemoRequest instead of BanPartyID.

- Oren Aharoni and Affan Baragazi will confirm once they are done with analysis

the generation of the Marsh File for SOHO Firma is 'technically' from OGW side not possible.

My understanding was that therefore it should not be possible in OSF to order the insurance options Cover/Cover Plus for customer type=SoHo Firma.

 

The Insurance Option are still shown on ACC2 for customer type SOHO Firma, can you pls check:

The Logic which handset insurance could be booked for SOHO is based on the tariffs. So for enterprise tariffs the cover socs are not allowed.

Also for legacy insurance 24HATAV23 and the old Cover Plus SOCs CO3* no rule exists to restrict them based on customer type.

Hi [~pallavi.kokate1@vodafone.com]  ,
may I ask you to provide the complete I1006 logs?

According to the User Story
[!https://bmcomviva.atlassian.net/images/icons/issuetypes/story.svg!|https://bmcomviva.atlassian.net/browse/VFDED2W90S-228][OS-46690] OMNIUS SAP-OIL: I want to receive EID number and SAPLocationType for e-sim compatible hardware Order/Package [OS-46690] - Vodafone Global Jira



We have a limit on the length of the SAPLocationType field. Lenght must not exceed 11 characters. If the length is greater, we shouldn`t submit this field to OGW.

Let`s consider the initial SAP file OSF_SAPSTAT_20240517104305.csv

!image-2024-05-29-16-29-33-254.png! The length of NOT_VFSTORE is 11. We have one more valueable CR character(in the green frame) - a carriage return. So this is the 12th.


We need to remove that extra carriage return, and the correct file will look like this:

!image-2024-05-29-16-30-23-451.png!

There is only one extra character left LF - line feed which is not valuable while parsing.

 

Considering all mentioned above we have several ways:
 # Remove this extra Carriage return symbol from the initial file - the most preferable way
OR

 # Extend the length up to 12 while parsing

Hi [~pallavi.kokate1@vodafone.com] 
thank you very much for SAP PRD file.

Let`s compare files for both PRD and ACC2:
PRD env:

!image-2024-05-30-18-34-48-136.png!

ACC2 env: 

!image-2024-05-30-18-36-04-348.png!
I`d like to pay your attention to the end of each line. Unlike ACC2, in PRD file each line ends with LF. For ACC2 each line ends with CR LF.
So, the SAP file structure is different.


Can you please make SAP file structure for ACC2 be the same as PRD: each line must end with LF?

if im changing omnius_oeder id it will be like so:

the error is coming when trying to connect to it;;;","29/May/24 10:15 AM;arndt.vorrath@vodafone.com;Hello Ran, I guess this is exactly the problem we talked about two weeks ago:

In the property_env_ACC2.xml file, there is this line for the proxy configuration:  <PROXY_SOLSTICE>46.190.173.79:8080</PROXY_SOLSTICE>

However, there is also this remark in the property file:

 <!--If Proxy if required then populate as <PROXY_SOLSTICE>PROXY=47.73.108.134:8080;</PROXY_SOLSTICE>

So for my understanding, we have to change the configuration line to this: <PROXY_SOLSTICE>{color:#de350b}*PROXY=*{color}47.73.108.134:8080{color:#de350b}*;*{color}</PROXY_SOLSTICE>;;;","29/May/24 11:44 AM;daniel.loos@vodafone.com;Hi [~ran.farjun1@vodafone.com] there seems to be missing a large chunk.

 If the agent has secondary roles assigned & those secondary roles have ALLOW_TELESALES/ ALLOW_RETAIL permission only then that button will be seen, as its related to role change if agent used for login has other roles assigned only then we can change to other roles.
 
Summary of CR724
!94648bad-105d-491e-9719-0c9aba79c8e3.png!
 
PFA
 
 
Note : 
that agent after logging in can move to other roles \{button Change Business function option will be visible} if & only if additional roles/ secondary roles are assigned to the agent used to login.. 
If no additional roles then button Change Business function option will not be visible - This is existing function, 
{ on release 9.18.14-B2 ST5 ( w8.2) - EXISTING} 

Only new change according to CR724:

Change Business function option will be visible if & only if additional roles/ secondary roles are assigned to the agent used to login & those additional roles/ secondary roles have permission ALLOW_TELESALES/ALLOW_RETAIL to be viewed in the respective channel Telesales or Retail. 

please check the agent used in ACC env for their additional roles is assigned & permissions of those additional roles

[~sneha.wayal1@vodafone.com]  At point no. 9 when customer searched again. Is the BEW status updated in the mode3 response for the customer.
Omnius refer to mode3 response while enabling or disabling the BEW erfassen button. If BEW permissions are not updated in mode3 response even after updating the version from frontend, then Omnius will keep the BEW erfassen button enabled;;;","28/May/24 5:13 PM;sneha.wayal1@vodafone.com;Hi [~ran.farjun1@vodafone.com] 

We have observed, BEW Version and BEW Permission is not getting updated in backend for All stacks from SetPermission call, Can you please check Is OGW is sending this request towards backend or it's returning stub response to Omnius because for each request we cannot see values are updating in legacy system.

 

Could you Please check.

While performing D2COC scenario we observed Yellow message banner with text 'Der Anschlusspreis von 39.99€ wurde wieder hinzugefügt' is not visible

Text in yellow banner should be 'Der Anschlusspreis von 39,99€ wurde wieder hinzugefügt'

*Test data*: GSM1721751999

*Pre-requisite*: Agent has permission DEBIT_TO_CREDIT permission

*Reference Story*: https://jira.sp.vodafone.com/browse/OS-47282

*Steps to reproduce*:

*Configurator*:
1. Login to Retail Channel.
2. Select mobile package
3. Select hardware & Tariff
4. Fill necessary details.
5. Do check the D2COC check box
6. Enter debit MSISDN and click on validation button
7. The First Name and Last Name fields (3 in total) should be auto-filled with data once the validation is successfully completed by the OGW response
8. The memo radio buttons should  allow selecting only one option at a time (standard radio button feature).
9. Subscriber activation Fees should be added back to the mobile postpaid activation package, if the D2C with owner change checkbox is unchecked. Meaning, the scenario is now a normal Postpaid ACQ
10. Omnius should show the banner/message to the Agent “Activation Fee <9.99> EUR was added to the shopping cart…”

*Actual result*: Now in yellow banner message activation fee is 39.99€ instead of 39,99€
""Der Anschlusspreis von 39.99€ wurde wieder hinzugefügt""

*Expected Result*: Omnius should show the banner/message text to the Agent should be

Hi Maheedha,

 

We don’t have access to PR region.

We already started to look this issue and kindly create Production ticket to work on this.

 

[@Carl-Georg Fließbach, Vodafone|mailto:carl-georg.fliessbach@vodafone.com] – it seems PROD also might have this issue. Kindly create PROD ticket if required.

 

Thanks and Regards,

Blank Anschluss issue is not there if we are using with capital letters.

<configured>{*}ANALOG{*}</configured>

Instead of

<configured>analog</configured>

 

POSFE is designed that our expectation for oldaccess element value is like below,

 
 # “keiner or  ANALOG or digital”  if customerContactPoint element value is “BPA or OSF”
 # “NEW or  ANALOG or P2MP or P2P or PRI ”  if customerContactPoint element value is  other than “BPA and OSF”

 

We faced this same issue earlier too “SPN-PF-000139226-O”.  as of now there is no requirement to make the changes in POSFE apps.

 

FYI, we will be rejecting this SPN with attaching this mail.;;;","30/May/24 7:03 PM;alka.kshirsagar2@vodafone.com;Hi [~vikash.saurav@vodafone.com]

hi [~satish.dhere1@vodafone.com] 
As per the check service availability response attached, I can see issue with below parameters.
 # In availability information,Indicatior color is red

!image-2024-05-22-12-12-13-606.png!

I can see for FTTH DTAG there 2 nodes with same priority (1). There should be 1 node with highest priority and highest bandwidth. as per that node it will show all data.

Here it is confusing because of 2 nodes with same priority (1). !image-2024-05-22-12-12-49-044.png!

Based on further analysis it is identified that for Generate Contract OSE is not getting the response in-time within set timeout of 60 seconds. Hence OSE is getting timeout waiting for response.

Further we checked logs we can see there is difference of 5 minutes between OSE-OIL request & OIL-OGW request.

 restart OIL service once and test again.

[~pallavi.kokate1@vodafone.com] [~ajay.bhavar@vodafone.com] fyi;;;","20/May/24 2:27 PM;darshan.ramlingapa@vodafone.com;Hi Sunil, we will retest once the ACC2 OIL application/servers are restarted and confirm ;;;","20/May/24 4:36 PM;pallavi.kokate1@vodafone.com;Again facing same issue after OIL restart

1) Arvind Nagar, Vodafone made changes in permission SQLAgentReaderRole and SQLAgentUserRole roles as workaround.

2) Restarted OIL server instanced. 

3) After restart order moving ahead, we will check after deployment once again and then close.

1) The job responsible to clean the mgsBozDB for BizTalk was failing due to insufficient permissions causing increased size of tables. We performed clean-up manually and requested for permission suggested by Vendor.

2)  Insufficient permission is according to the error, actually the permission are same on old running environments and new ACC2 but still we are getting permission denied error. We have requested for permissions which we didn't had before even on working environment.

Steps to reproduce for Telesales channel:

1) Enter unitymedia or VKD adress -> new customer
2) Add KUD product e.g. GigaTV Net, 1.{-}6. Monat 0,{-}€
3) move to checkout, fill in customer details > customer adress in Germany
4) reach to IBAN section, type in GERMAN IBAN e.g. DE20700500000003658888 (Any German IBAN can be taken!)
->IBAN validation is running and successfull
5) Select invoice adress as customer adress and do NOT select any different bank account holder
6) Klick on ""weiter"" and get error message

_{color:#ff0000}Die ausgewählten kabel-unabhängigen Produkte (z.B. GigaTV App und Net) lassen seit dem 01.04.2018 eine Nutzung innerhalb der gesamten EU zu. Aber nach gesetzlichen Vorgaben nur von Kunden mit festem Wohnsitz in Deutschland.){color}_

_{color:#ff0000}Die Prüfung der Bankverbindung hat ergeben, dass eine ausländische Bankverbindung oder ein abweichender Kontoinhaber angegeben wurden.{color}_

_{color:#ff0000}Leider kann aus diesen Gründen die Prüfung auf festen Wohnsitz in Deutschland nur über den nächsten Vodafone-Shop erfolgen. Bringen Sie hierzu Ihren Personalausweis oder eine Meldebescheinigung mit.{color}_

 

We are not using foreign customer adress or foreign IBAN, and also +*not*+ using foreign invoice adress or different bank account holder
It is not the problem, that its going to be validated if there is any data from foreign countries used! The validation itself is correct process - but the result is wrong! It has to be identified by the system, that this customer is allowed to pay the products so we are able to move to the next section.

 

It seems the booking works sometimes, and sometimes not. Or maybe only for specific constellation of KUD products it works. We need to investigate if there is an issue with the software or not

 # Agent clicks on SECOND DELIVERY (Zweitversand) button and created a valid shopping cart
 # Agent reached to checkout page on Customer data section.
 # Verify Customer identification section.

Actual: Omnius allows to select new identification menthod in Kundenidentifikation section for second delivery use case.

Expected: *Agent should see ident method section in read only mode as Agent cannot change manually* and Agent should see error banner with text message in case same Original order ident method is not available in interface RetrieveIdentificationMethods response and sales flow should stop.

Checking with KIAS team. As its KIAS side issue, PRT raised- KIAS is not sending Simsize tag to OGW ;;;","28/May/24 12:38 PM;ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com;[~shweta.yenkar@vodafone.com]  thanks, as its open since 2 weeks, we really need to speed up here. Please let me know if I need to escalate;;;","29/May/24 5:58 PM;shweta.yenkar@vodafone.com;No resolution received yet.
Below mail initiated.
OSF | Wave 9.0 | ACC2 | eSIM Push (part 1) | Simsize attribute is missing in KIAS MMO response for D2C customer;;;","29/May/24 9:33 PM;ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com;I have seen ticket in SIT not sure if same, there are already some analysis results also OS-56600 SIT4 | Not getting SIMCARDSIZE details in GetCustomerDetails response for D2C scenarios - Vodafone Global Jira

 

At least ACC team defect is also mentioned here;;;","30/May/24 3:56 PM;pallavi.kokate1@vodafone.com;Yes Ari assigning back this Defect to OGW,same comment in PRT as well

• KIAS confirmed that In CREDIT market SIM_SIZE will be populated and sent to EAI and in DEBIT market SIM_CARD_SIZE will be populated and sent to EAI
• We found that it is working fine in case of Postpaid customers
• We checked OGW logs and found that EAI is sending simCardSize in GetSubscriber Response of Prepaid customers
• OGW needs to check where is it missing and why is it not populating in GetCustomerDetails Mode2 response.;;;","31/May/24 2:14 PM;ran.farjun1@vodafone.com;i [~pallavi.kokate1@vodafone.com] ,

as i mention before, EAI is sending the simCardSize in a different location then the other cases.

are you expecting OGW to change current behavior?;;;","31/May/24 4:39 PM;pallavi.kokate1@vodafone.com;Hi [~ran.farjun1@vodafone.com] 
As per the OS-56600 defect, Amdocs test team has already discussed this issue with Amdocs BA.
As per the latest discussion, OGW should check SimCardSize for MMO (Prepaid) instead of SimSize, Can you please check and update.;;;","31/May/24 7:37 PM;ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com;Feedback via Email

According Amdocs  KIAS behaves in following way:

SIM_SIZE field (introduced with CS1506) is populated only in MMC Market and it is populated from sim_size of main Sim Card for Subscriber

SIM_SIZE field does not exists in MMO Market

SIM_CARD_SIZE field (introduced in CS866) is populated in MMC Market with hard coded value in case that sim_size of main Sim Card is Duobill, Tricard/Twi Card. For all other main sim Types (eSim, Tripplesim) it is empty.

SIM_CARD_SIZE field is populated with sim_size of main Sim Card of subscriber in MMO Market

In EAI the fields are according Spec (is MFSubscriber-007:GetSubscriber used from OSF ?) mapped 1:1
|SIM_SIZE| |GetSubscriberResponse/subscriberDetails/additionalData/simSize|
|SIM__CARD__SIZE| |GetSubscriberResponse/subscriberDetails/simCardSize|

I propose to check in a common call to avoid both - KIAS and OGW - are doing things and in the end we will again have a mismatch [~gaurav.lanjewar1@vodafone.com]  [~alka.kshirsagar2@vodafone.com] ;;;","03/Jun/24 12:52 PM;priyanka.dhumal@vodafone.com;Update from [~ran.farjun1@vodafone.com]  :

Not considered as a CR.;;;","04/Jun/24 12:53 PM;ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com;[~deepak.garg1@vodafone.com]  please confirm delivery date. we cannot wait until Friday to get it.

Mobile -->OPT
DSL--> IT 

So where we trigger any DSL order-- customer creation is getting done in DSL IT Env but specific the SetPermission call configuration for EAI(OPT) is pointing to PR Env. so current problem is that SetPermission is trying to search a IT env created customer in PR due to which we are getting no customer found issue

In EAI connections are as below :-
EAI(OPT)-->PR
EAI(INT)-->IT

So this defect would need to be tested once we switch to PR env;;;","17/May/24 5:45 PM;natasa.dimovic1@vodafone.com;Retest on ACC2 after switch to PR environment – > {*}test passed{*}, no EAI Sky Tickets have been created after the DSL/ FIBER TA run;;;",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Hi Nasir ,

Based on further analysis it is identified that the agent is not having ENABLE_ESIMSERIALNUMBER permission, this permission is needed to test flow without ESIM part-1 changes.

As we don’t have ENABLE_ESIMSERIALNUMBER permission some additional validation were failed.

Kindly assign permission and test same.;;;","22/May/24 7:04 PM;nasir.sayyad@vodafone.com;Hello,

After given ENABLE_ESIMSERIALNUMBER permission, flow is working as expected. Hence closing the defect.

This issue is occurring because of Omnius is sending SIM Type as N and without SIM SIZE, This is happening because Omnius is asking to enter Physical SIM Number even if agent has selected standard porting option in checkout (functionality is part of OS-10435 ESIM Epic).

Expected ->
In case agent opted Porting, Omnius should show only Radio button Physical SIM without SIM Card Text field and E-SIM and when agent select Physical SIM, Omnius should send SIM Type as S and SIM SIZE as TC in Fulfillment mode toward OGW.

Hi [~jayshri.dave@vodafone.com] 

Based on further analysis we come to know there is no requirement saying to hide Physical SIM Number on Physical SIM radio button selection if agent has selected Standard porting.

Also steps are not clear like
 # its for new customer or existing customer(if existing customer the mode logs needed.),

 # also in checkout what values are selecting on new connection section. Along with screenshots of the same.

 # also we don't see Process order request xml.

Kindly share these logs and arrange call for the same

Hi Team,

As discussed we are delivering latest build to ACC2 on Monday EOD, it is expected to fix many checkout related issues.

Kindly check it offline after deployment, still any issues lets connect again on Tuesday.

Please retest this defect after next full delivery and deployment on ACC2 Env with the latest build once and then confirm whether the issue is resolved or not.

CR724 logic works in this way.
Agent has 3 levels of priority to login to Telesales/Retail
1. Agent Primary role 2.Agent Secondary role 3. Agent store view permission 

Case : Agent primary role has no ALLOW_TELESALES permission , Agent has Secondary roles with ALLOW_TELESALES permission, Agent also has Telesales store view permission.
 # System is going to first check if agent primary role has permission to login to Telesales ( ie. as ALLOW_TELESALES/ ALLOW_RETAIL).

 # If agent primary role does not have permission, system is going to look out for Agent secondary role ie ( Business functions) & if the secondary role has ALLOW_TELESALES/ ALLOW_RETAIL permission, then agent is provided with ROLE CHANGE drop down to choose a Role. 
Note: 
Roles with ALLOW_TELESALES will be displayed in role change drop down in Telesales.
Roles with ALLOW_RETAIL will be displayed in role change drop down in Retail.

 # If the agent has no primary role or secondary role with ALLOW_TELESALES/ ALLOW_RETAIL PERMISSION then priority is given to Agent store view permission.

Based on this logic the above defect is invalid.

But we are unable to login with agent role in which primary agent doesn't have ""Allow_Telesales""/""Allow_Retail"" permission in case of multiple agent role present in a user.

That agent role will not be visible in ""Change Business Function"" option, since it doesnt have ""Allow_Telesales"" permission.

Could you tell us how we can change into role which doesnt have ""Allow_telesales""/""Allow_Retail"" permission;;;","06/May/24 4:00 PM;ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com;I am checking with TechM and will share the expecation here later, to have the full picture of the functionality;;;","06/May/24 4:44 PM;ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com;I have now discussed with TechM. 

Akash you are right, any Telesales/COPS role without permission ""Allow_Telesales"" will not be usable anymore, if the user has other roles which have the permission

1) If you have ONLY one role, and this role is without permission """"Allow_Telesales"" , but this role has Telesale store view, you can log in
2) If ANY of the roles of your user has the permission ""Allow_Telesales"", you can only log in with this role which has the permission and the other roles cannot be used anymore, even not when trying to change via ""Geschäftsfunktion ändern"". Telesales store view setting will be ignored

I have painted the picture in enclosed power point - was checked by Pragathi
I will also share with requestor, as not sure if this is expected. This would mean each role needs either ""Allow Telesales"" or ""Allow Retail"", not possible without this permission anymore as its not so likely that some user has one role only.

For testing we should maybe check the following:
-> One user +*with only one role*+ without ""allow Telesales"" Permission, Telesales store view is set -> *should be able to login*

 

*and the roles we need to use should ALL get Allow Telesales/ Allow Retail*;;;","06/May/24 5:21 PM;akash.ubbu@vodafone.com;Hi [~ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com] ,

[~gaurav.lanjewar1@vodafone.com] The RCA is If we refresh page or change role after loading the customer, for case of UCT mode 3 service is not getting called as result we are not getting BEW information, which intern is failed to collect BEW value on voicelog.
meanwhile As a workaround we can just change the role first and then load UCT link or not refresh the page after customer loaded.;;;","27/May/24 11:56 AM;atharva.paskanthi@vodafone.com;[~vikash.saurav@vodafone.com] , any ETA when will we get permanent Fix for this?

 ;;;","28/May/24 1:14 PM;vikash.saurav@vodafone.com;RCA : If we refresh the page after customer is loaded in uct flow we are triggering mode 1 2 3 again there but was getting error
{""error"":true,""data"":[],""warning"":false,""tempCustomer"":false,""isBEWAllowed"":false,""message"":""BEW Information ist momentan nicht verf\u00fcgbar"",""allowedBEWPermission"":[]}

and BEW section was not available in voice log page and if we create offer without bew permission
while editing offfer where the offer should land was decided based on whether we have bew permission or not. so offer was landing on customer details instead of voice log page.

I'm currently checking if that is not working as designed because I don't remember getting a ticket for disabling the message hint. If it truly should be disabled, then we'd need a separate ticket through TTWOS since it's a config change.

Hi [~shweta.yenkar@vodafone.com]  ,

We have reduce the offer container size till 7 where the API is working fine and responding in-time. More than 8 offer containers API is getting timed-out.

Reason behind may be the unused quote / offer / order data which is taking time when we query during the API call.

I suggest to check and run the unusedQuoteCleaning.php script if this is allowed on ACC2 env, so this can clear some set number of days old offer, quote and orders.

Also as WA I have suggested to limit the number of Offer containers to max 7 until the cleanup of old data happen.;;;","23/May/24 6:11 PM;shweta.yenkar@vodafone.com;Yes , Till 7 offer container we received success response , more than 7 it gives timeout error.

Hi all [~shweta.yenkar@vodafone.com]  ,

Firstly issue is not reproducible in any of our environments to debug further and analysis the area where we need improvement. In our ST & also on development environment the time taken to respond is less than 20 seconds for 9 offer containers. Also there is already handling present in OSE in order to service the API with only the necessary actions.
We tried to deploy the debug patch in order to collect the logs which are going to help us in identifying the areas of code which are taking time to respond. Most of the logs we collected points to core functions so we need to be carefully handle the changes here.
We are working on the same and we update ASAP.
Kindly check is there any difference in environment setup of ACC1/ACC3 & ACC2 IB API

*1st Change* :

*2nd Chnage:*

ACC1 OSE Version Deployed on ACC2 : tested API on ACC2 with  9.18.12-B2 -- Failed 

 

{*}Conclusion{*}: Irrespective of having different OSE API Versions failing on ACC2.

Hi Ari,

Yes, We have an access for ACC Env, but the thing is we can logged in via citrix and sometimes ACC ENv is bit slow compared to VF team can access from their end.

Coming to the logs capturing:

we can access archive logs but we cannot save directly into our local machine(to my system) we can copy from there (inside Citrix machine) and paste in into our local system notepad and then we can save it in our local system.

if one or 2 logs means we can do it but still the time consuming is more.

 

So we requesting VF team always to provide logs as they can access much faster and directly they can save any kind of logs into their local machine(System).

 

Meanwhile we can work on another 2 tickets parallel :)

 

This is the only concern for us, so requesting logs with VF tester(reporter).

 ;;;","07/Jun/24 12:18 PM;maheedhar.bekkem@vodafone.com;Hi Ari,

Hi Maheedhar,

Based on further analysis on rules via debug rule logs, the problematic product *KVOLTE* is allowed based on the service allowed rules the product allowed by {_}+Service defaulted rule+{_}({*}21685565 Comp. Rule 26 - SOC_Relation Add/Add Soc{*}) , _+Service allowed rule+_ ++ ({*}21685565 Comp. Rule 26 - SOC_Relation Add/Add Soc{*}) and added to cart then the _+Service not allowed rule+_ evaluated to true ({*}536746, Name: 21698482 Comp. Rule 68 - Disallow SOCs with lower priority in KIAS SOC OnlyOne Plausi{*}) and the product removed from cart and we can see same missing on {*}Final allowed products skus{*}:[""F_OSF002_0"",""F_OSF003_0"",""F_OSF004_0"",""F_OSF005_0"",""F_OSF007_0"",""KRFLATEUUS"",""K5GFREE"",""KNO5GSA"",""KDASROW1D"",""KVF_DASRP"",""KVOWIFREEC"",""KSO_EL_SIM"",""KCFD_SMS"",""KLTEDEF""].

Based on above analysis this is purely the PCAT rules based on that we are getting the pop which says *""The following product(s): [KVOLTE] VoLTE Basic cannot be added because they are incompatible with the current selection""*

Error: There is currently no shop assigned to you. Please contact the Sales Service Line

 

Normally even if agent does not have ""Allow_Telesales"" or ""Allow_Retail"" permission, then it should check for store view permission and even store view permission is not there then it should throw an error. But the error should be different not above error.

But in our case it does not have ""Allow_Telesales"" permission, but it has Telesales store view permission so it should be able to login without any error. But we are getting above error while logging in.

 

Steps to reproduce:
 # Check if agent role is not having ""Allow_Telesales"" permission
 # Check if telesales store view permission is assigned.
 # login to omnius
 # try to login
 # observe the error.

In Omnius, calculate the Ident method visibility based on total HW price in Order

e.g.
|*Total HW Price Range*|*Possible ident*|
|0-1000 €|All Ident possible|
|1000-1200 €|Only Store & Web Ident; (Hide/Disable?) Door Ident|
|greater than 1200 €|Only Web ident|

 

From <https://jira.sp.vodafone.com/browse/OAF-313>

 

With a  (mobile) shopping cart value smaller than 1.199 EUR the following ident methods are available in checkout:
 * Min 0€ / Max 1.199€
 * Online-Ident
 * Store-Ident
 * Door-Ident

With value higher 1.199 EUR
 * Online-Ident
 * Store Ident

 

 

Steps Reproduce:

1) Login to Telesales using BO agent

2) Configure the package and select HW with 0-1000 euros and check if we get mentioned or define all 4 customer identification options during checkout in customer identification section

 

Actual Result

Currently if we select any HW within Defined range we see unexpected behavior during checkout in Customer identification section and its not working as expected following below table rules
|*Total HW Price Range*|*Possible ident*|
|0-1000 €|All Ident possible|
|1000-1200 €|Only Store & Web Ident; (Hide/Disable?) Door Ident|
|greater than 1200 €|Only Web ident|

 

Expected Result:

HW selected from Configurator should show the number of options in customer identification section accordingly following the below table
|*Total HW Price Range*|*Possible ident*|
|0-1000 €|All Ident possible|
|1000-1200 €|Only Store & Web Ident; (Hide/Disable?) Door Ident|

because OS-54780 already fixed and delivered with  CN # KIAS2000_CN_18399. 

 

and follow below point 


The Visibility of Geschäftsfunktion ändern tab depends on the agent secondary role & its assigned Store view permission ALLOW_TELESALES or ALLOW_RETAIL

Example:
 # Agent1 has Primary role SUPERAGENT with ALLOW_TELESALES & ALLOW_RETAIL Permission is assigned.

 # Agent1 also has few Secondary roles assigned ie TELESALES, BACKOFFICE, COPS AGENT.

 # 
 ## If Secondary roles does not have ALLOW_TELESALES permission Geschäftsfunktion ändern tab will not be visible in TELESALES channel as we only allow to change the agent role for secondary agents roles with ALLOW_TELESALES. (Same logic for Retail )

 # 
 ## If Secondary roles have ALLOW_TELESALES permission Geschäftsfunktion ändern tab will be visible in TELESALES channel as we only allow to change the agent role for secondary agents roles with ALLOW_TELESALES. (Same logic for Retail )
_*Note :*_ Geschäftsfunktion ändern tab & drop down will show only Secondary agent roles list with respective store view permission ALLLOW_TELESALES or ALLOW_RETAIL.

 # Unless & until Secondary roles for the agent does not have the respective store view permission then change of role ( Geschäftsfunktion ändern tab ) is not visible.;;;","23/Apr/24 11:44 AM;gaurav.lanjewar1@vodafone.com;Comment from Sandeep:

Test data:

Browser: Chrome
Environment: ACC1 
Channel: Telesales + Retail

Steps to reproduce the issue:
 - Enter address: Goethestr. 27 26409 Wittmund Wittmund
 - Select package: ""Kabel Internet & Phone""
 - Select tariff: ""[3BV:B09] GigaZuhause 250 Kabel, 1.-9. Monat 19,99 €""
 - Select goody on ""Gutschriften und Aktionen"" section: ""[JL5] Gutschrift GigaZuhause Young: 1.-9. Monat: 0 €, 10.-24. Monat: -5 €, danach 0 €""
 - open basket

The prices are not calculated as expected.
As a consequence of the wrong basket also the contract summary is incorrect.

!image-2024-04-10-18-00-56-136.png|width=856,height=463!  

+Pre-Analyses of product configuration team:+
OSF uses the 'Price sliding' field from the Product Catalog to configure the way the price periods are shown in the frontend:

!screenshot-1.png|width=338,height=226!

The numbers in this field are however interpreted as absolute points in time. They should however be interpreted as relative time intervals.

+Concretely this means:+

Price sliding '9:6:' should be interpreted as 0.-9. month, 10.-15. month, 16. month onward.
Currently it is interpreted as 0.-9. month, 0.-6. month, whatever comes afterward.
This obviously does not make any sense, since the second period ends before the first one, so the consequence in the frontend is, that the second period is ignored.

+The obvious fix therefore is:+
The numbers in the ""Price sliding"" field should always be interpreted as *relative time* intervalls.

 

+Additional proof:+
When checking in the OSF Backoffice for the product properties, the price_sliding of JL5 looks like this:

!image-2024-04-09-15-34-39-869.png!

Looking at this in overview in the frontend, the second time intervall seems to be ignored:

!image-2024-04-10-18-00-56-136.png|width=423,height=229!

Manually changing it to 15 then leads to the following view in OSF:

!image-2024-04-09-15-42-29-039.png|width=737,height=206!

This is, however, still wrong. OSF seems to tread the numbers in the PCAT import as absolute times instead of relative intervals

=> Three sliding prices are in principle possible to show, but the configuration in the product setup is imported and interpreted wrongly",,alka.kshirsagar2@vodafone.com,ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com,atharva.paskanthi@vodafone.com,gaurav.lanjewar1@vodafone.com,gokul.vade@vodafone.com,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,OAF-762,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"02/May/24 12:50 PM;stephanie.krammer@vodafone.com;OSF Incident Ticket - CRImprovement notwendig - OS-54646 OSF  ACC1  Wave 8.2  sliding prices are not interpreted as expected - Vodafone Global Jira.msg;https://jira.sp.vodafone.com/secure/attachment/1281954/OSF+Incident+Ticket+-+CRImprovement+notwendig+-+OS-54646+OSF++ACC1++Wave+8.2++sliding+prices+are+not+interpreted+as+expected+-+Vodafone+Global+Jira.msg","10/Apr/24 9:33 PM;stephanie.krammer@vodafone.com;image-2024-04-09-15-34-39-869.png;https://jira.sp.vodafone.com/secure/attachment/1267853/image-2024-04-09-15-34-39-869.png","10/Apr/24 9:34 PM;stephanie.krammer@vodafone.com;image-2024-04-09-15-42-29-039.png;https://jira.sp.vodafone.com/secure/attachment/1267854/image-2024-04-09-15-42-29-039.png","10/Apr/24 9:30 PM;stephanie.krammer@vodafone.com;image-2024-04-10-18-00-56-136.png;https://jira.sp.vodafone.com/secure/attachment/1267849/image-2024-04-10-18-00-56-136.png","11/Apr/24 12:55 PM;stephanie.krammer@vodafone.com;pcat-without-fix.tar.xz;https://jira.sp.vodafone.com/secure/attachment/1268028/pcat-without-fix.tar.xz","10/Apr/24 9:32 PM;stephanie.krammer@vodafone.com;screenshot-1.png;https://jira.sp.vodafone.com/secure/attachment/1267851/screenshot-1.png",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,The issue is a show stopper for the Go Live of Young Promotion feature which is planned for April Main Release 29.04,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,OS-49399,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"v9.18.5-BB1 2024-04-02 06:59 |04-09|21-54",Fixed with CR826 in Wave 9.2 release ,,Cable,Omnius,ACC,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Green,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"0|i9j9qv:",9223372036854775807,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Backlog - UNCOVERED,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Code,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,TechM -> PCAT,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"11/Apr/24 11:55 AM;ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com;[~vikash.saurav@vodafone.com]  [~bharath.krishnamurthy@vodafone.com]  please check this on priority, if you need a call to discuss the details we can organize it but we need to be fast.

we had a three hours call today investigating the poor performance of CS creation.

First we tried to stop one of the Ignite instances and restart it again. That needed much more time than expected. With further investigation we (again) found that the databases already have a very bad performance. This is now under investigation by DBA team. It will need some time -we are not talking about production environment- until Monday cob. So hopefully then we will have a result and we plan a restart of the DBs in second MW on Monday (4pm CET).;;;","30/Apr/24 12:48 PM;ajay.yashwantbhavar@vodafone.com;Today we are again observing CS is taking too much time to generated on ACC2 ENV.

 * Amdocs confirmed once that the introduction of CR604 will not affect the previous implementation (no CR604 configuration -> ""business as usual"").
 * CR604 was delivered without any initial configuration and even without the instructions how to apply this configuration. 

Now, we see that the configuration as per CR604 seems to be mandatory for the detected use cases.

im checking with my team how to proceed.;;;","13/May/24 4:46 PM;ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com;[~ran.farjun1@vodafone.com]  [~laxmikant.agrawal@vodafone.com]  any update?;;;","15/May/24 6:31 PM;gaurav.lanjewar1@vodafone.com;Hi [~ran.farjun1@vodafone.com]  can you please share your input.;;;","15/May/24 9:53 PM;ran.farjun1@vodafone.com;Hi,

yes, currently the fix is almost ready after discussions with design team and Ketaki.

in this fix the 24 retry will not be in use anymore, instead the retry will be determined by the ogw_error_handler table.

it will decide how many times to retry, and how much time to wait between the calls.

for this flow the retry will be active for empty response from oneDMS or OGWERR-9900 error code return

for example:
this is a record from the table:

{
    ""ERROR_CODE"":""OGWERR-9900"",
    ""ERROR_CATEGORY"":""Technical"",
    ""IGNORE_ERROR_IND"":""N"",
    ""RETRYABLE_IND"":""TRUE"",
    ""MAX_RETRY_TIMES"":""3"",
    ""RETRY_WAIT_TIME"":""10"",
    ""MAX_WAIT_TIME"":null,
    ""STATUS_TO_SET"":null,
    ""CHANNEL"":""TELESALES"",
    ""SERVICE_CALL"":""ASYNC"",
    ""SERVICE_NAME"":""OneDMS""
}
so the flow will retry 3 times and the wait time will be 10 seconds between every try.;;;","16/May/24 4:05 PM;ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com;informed [~kirill.leibov1@vodafone.com]  to get in touch with Ran to discuss if the solution is ok from vodafone side;;;","17/May/24 1:34 PM;kirill.leibov1@vodafone.com;The existing solution with 24 tries must be {+}not removed{+}, but it shall remain as the +default+ behavior in the case, that we do not have no configuration in the ogw_error_handler table.;;;","19/May/24 1:34 PM;ran.farjun1@vodafone.com;thanks Kiril,

The changes which are needed on OSF side, to make ILS Flow work again, are currently planned for wave 9.1 [OS-34912] Shift creation of composite order from OSE to Template Engine in ILS context - Vodafone Global Jira

we dont have any Solstice products deployed on our system, so we need to wait until the catalog is updated

without Solstice products we cannot load any customer due to inventory check.;;;","15/Mar/24 3:28 PM;tanvi.bagade@vodafone.com;Hi [~arndt.vorrath@vodafone.com], I have retested the flow but same error observed :

This is the answer from Raniero:

You need to check with OSF, this is what OSF is sending:
and OSF is sending a request for an UM customer (BW = Baden Württenberg).

This is a urn for a VKD customer:

This is a urn for a UM customer:

!image-2024-02-07-12-09-00-539.png!

In SoapUI you are sending a request for a VKD customer, OSF sends a request for an UM customer.

Could you please check that again? Thanks;;;","07/Feb/24 5:33 PM;vikash.saurav@vodafone.com;Divya Kumbla added a comment -
 
 
Hi [~natasa.dimovic1@vodafone.com]  ,Again the decision of whether the customer is VKD or UM is based on AccountCategory in getCustomerResult for index search

and Region in retrieveCustomerInfo mode1 for Legacysearch.

For reference

!image-2024-02-07-17-32-45-292.png!

So we need to check what is coming for this customer for which you need to share the search response and mode1 response logs.;;;","07/Feb/24 6:06 PM;natasa.dimovic1@vodafone.com;Hi [~vikash.saurav@vodafone.com] please find attached the logs;;;","08/Feb/24 1:12 PM;vikash.saurav@vodafone.com;Divya Kumbla added a comment -
 
Hi [~natasa.dimovic1@vodafone.com] 

As said earlier the region from mode1 decides if its VKD or UM, and as per attached logs we receive region as UME-KBW hence OSE considers it as UM customer.

 * As the ADDRESS REGION is in UM Area - it is treated as UM customer, even though he belongs to the VKD Stack

h4. _Possible SD option to be validated/proven:_ 
 * Derive customer stack from GlobalID prefix (""legacy stack"")  instead of address region
 * IF improvements required as this is only known by OGW (Omnius can only see LK_ from linked customers) - e.g. introducing new attribute to indicate customers product stack:
 * CustomerSearch()
 * getCustomerDetails()
 * [@Mitra, Gaurab, External Vendor|mailto:gaurab.mitra@amdocs.com]: We should investigate if further interfaces have to be considered (To be discussed on next CR meeting)

Hallo Joachim,

 

I wanted to get back to you briefly on the subject of ""ReadyAPI"".

 

In the meantime, I have now got the tool installed on my VDI and can perform the tests on my own. In general, there seems to be no problem with the connectivity to the license server, I can reach the server via web browser asl as well as via curl-command if a proxy is configured in the Windows system settings. However, the ReadyAPI tool doesn't seem to be using this system proxy, and even when manually configuring the proxy in the login screen, the connection doesn't work.

Maybe the Windows firewall on the VDI is also preventing the connection, I'm going to create a ticket today to check the firewall settings.

I'll get back to you as soon as I have any news...;;;","16/May/24 8:52 PM;ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com;[~gauri.bhagat@vodafone.com]  any update here?;;;","17/May/24 12:31 PM;gokul.vade@vodafone.com;Hi [~ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com] 

--Latest Update *Gesendet:* Dienstag, 7. Mai 2024 15:44

Hallo Joachim,

 

sorry, ich hatte mich lange nicht mehr bei Dir mit einem Status-Update gemeldet ☹

 

Anscheinend ignoriert ReadyAPI jede Proxy-Einstellung (egal ob direkt im Tool oder indirekt über das Windows-System), daher habe wir Anfang letzter Woche einen Firewall-Request (OOT-1506) für eine Direktverbindung in Auftrag gegeben mit folgenden Daten:

Leider habe ich bis jetzt noch kein Due Date erhalten (FW-Requests für VKD-Ziele dauern leider immer länger), aber ich werde Dich auf jeden Fall informieren, sobald ich neue Informationen habe.

for the first request i can see that:

so seems like VKD customer.
for the second request:

TargetSystem is empty, if its UM it should be like so:
<TargetSystem>UM</TargetSystem>

else we will sent is as VKD customer;;;","22/Jan/24 8:57 PM;ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com;Hi [~vikash.saurav@vodafone.com]  as per information from Ran something is missing in the setpermission request, so not sure if something is wrong on Ominus/OSE Side? can you please check and share your input? ;;;","24/Jan/24 11:55 AM;vikash.saurav@vodafone.com;SunilkumarCM added a comment - 
 
Hi [~ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com]  ,

I don't see the steps to reproduce and if its for existing customer we need mode logs and serviceability logs between OSE<->OIL & OIL<->OGW.

Thanks

[~alka.kshirsagar2@vodafone.com] fyi;;;","24/Jan/24 3:56 PM;ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com;[~vikash.saurav@vodafone.com]  I was not creating any order, I am just scanning portal UI tool from time to time to find unidentified issues. And within this quality check I have found tickets with this error message. 

 

After some analysis I have identified, that it seems to be this scenario:

-> Search existing unitymedia customer and perform Move to VKD adress 

 

this is example Order ID from ACC1 - it failed with 2 sky tickets

One ticket because of invalid VPKN (issue is solved, please ignore that) and second sky ticket was for setpermission.


Unfortunately Sky ticket were cleared in between so I am not able to find my two tickets anymore..... But hopefully you can reproduce on your environment for a Move from Unity to VKD.

Seems like in this case the existing customer ID from unity is taken over, instead of recognizing that customer will get a new customer ID from VKD for Move scenario

 

Order ID 782545, Customer ID 1009755201 (initial customer before Move) 

!image-2024-01-24-11-21-17-927.png!

 

Same seems to happen when moving from Unity Cable to DSL product. 

So please check flow Unity Cable to VKD Cable Move, and Unity Cable to DSL Move

 ;;;","25/Jan/24 5:24 PM;ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com;We have placed another order yesterday.

*Move from Unity Cable to VKD Cable* with permission selection in checkout.
Omnius Order ID 783467

 

In SetPermission Call I see that its called for Cable - {*}UN{*}, but the target customer is VKD Customer after Move. 



So I would expect in the setpermission call that system is calling VKD with new VKD customer ID, right? It does not make sense to store a permission in unitymedia backend when the customer is going to be inactive there, and will be active only in VKD in the future with new customer ID

Hi [~ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com]  ,

Further based on investigation above is the expected behavior. Which means for the existing customer we are getting the region value from Install Base and if region value which is from the IB or from the serviceability(in ACQ) is not matching with the below table data which is agreed during the design, then OSE send empty <CustomerList><CustomerDetails>{*}<TargetSystem>{*}.

If for any new region value VF expects to send *TargetSystem* value then it has to be added to OSE via SRT

We are not able to access TTWOS or at least only very limited people who are not available right now. Can you give us details about Z_INC02716593A? 

So is there also ticket raised towards TechM for this issue, even when opening the TV package in configurator first? 
If not, is this issue on TechM side as per your analysis and not related to cable rules setup?

[~ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com] I think the behaviour by OSF that the error message is shown in case a inconsistent technician selection is made by the agent can be assumed to be correct. I at least would not know what the expected outcome of such a selection would be.

The following part from your comment could be the solution to this:
{panel}
*BUT this is not expected as per Ticket from PROD:*

Expected behavior after fix Z_PRT00133532A

This means the option for TV is not visible anymore, if I got it right. Therefore there can also not be any mismatch between TV and KIP installation options.

Your assumption regarding the TV section then not being visible is correct.

From our tests I would also assume that the TV section shouldn't be visible in this case [Quelle von vkdTechnicianOptions.feature - productSetup - webgit (kabeldeutschland.de)|https://webgit.kabeldeutschland.de/projects/FE/repos/productsetup/browse/4DevelopmentOnly/tests/unified/features/availability/vkdTechnicianOptions.feature#239-259]:

Yes, exactly, we shouldn't see any of these options anymore for VFW customers. That should already be deployed on ACC2. Once we can confirm it works properly, we can reject this bug (I have never seen this error message, I wonder what causes it).

I double checked in our logs and attached them here as well (cable rules artifact logs), maybe they help.
The scenario I clicked was:
 * load existing KIP customer
 * open kip package
 * open (new) mobile package
 * select any bundle eligible mobile tariff -> bundle drawer pops up
 * create the bundle by clicking the bundle drawer
 * go to checkout -> see message
 * logs of this state: [^cable_rules_artifact_OS47914_pre_workaround.log]
 * open kip package
 * select any option and deselect it again
 * logs of this state:
[^cable_rules_artifact_OS47914_post_workaround.log]

When checking the logs notice that no posting rules are executed after the bundle is created and before the workaround is applied.

Hi Alexander/Simon,

This is not a code issue I have checked working PCAT with the ACC1/ACC2 codebase in my local environment and it's working fine, seems something wrong with the ACC2 PCAT.

I have checked Rules manager and some differences found in the rules also in both the PCAT's so both PCT’s are not same.

Total Rules: 73185 
Mobile: 62760
KIP Ruls: 5168
KABLE TV Rules: 4450

The problem is, that ACC2 is having January catalogue since today, as PST is testing next release. So maybe first of all the issue has to be reproducable with new catalogue.

Hi Alexander/Simon,
 
 For extended shopping cart min max equal warning rules, there is not relation with cable post rule results or execution.
The rule which is problematic, is a max(0) rule and service to category rule. So if this rule’s service source expression evaluates to true than it will check if cart have max 0 number of products only from the target category. So if product OMNIUSTVCHANGEDMARKER is not part of the package then problematic rule service source expression will evaluate to true and further it will show warning if from target category we have more then 0 products in cart.;;;","14/Dec/23 2:55 PM;simon.auch@vodafone.com;Hi [~bharath.krishnamurthy@vodafone.com],

the relation is implicit, the posting rules select the OMNIUSTVCHANGEDMARKER once there is any change to the package. OSF needs to call the posting rules after any change to cable packages including bundle rules.

Hi Alexander/Simon,
 
The logic implemented long back cannot be modified as it may cause additional adversary problems. However, if you require this logic to be changed, it will require the involvement of design team.;;;","14/Dec/23 4:54 PM;simon.auch@vodafone.com;[~ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com], I am not sure if there was any more specific documentation (I will keep searching for a bit), but the following HLD already has a section:
|*Cable artifact rules*
 
The Cable Catalog and PLM colleagues have requested their own rules engine to be applied in the configurator. This is realised with a plugin development where Cable colleagues can upload their Rules Artifact as part of the PLM process. This Rules Artifact consists of the same Sales Rules (in PHP language/cable-speak) that is used currently in ECC front-ends. OMNIUS will share the full-shoppingcart (all packages) to the Rules Artifact, the rules artifact will process ruling, and return the shoppingcart object with modified cable orderlines in Kabel TV, KIP and KUD packages to be displayed in OMNIUS. The Rules Artifact will be called both before a product is selected (on show of configurator, pre-condition) {*}as well as after selecting a product (on adding to the shoppingcart, post-condition){*}. OMNIUS will not be able to have special GUI handling like for internal OMNIUS sales rules when using the Artifact.|

From a slightly newer HLD:
|Apart from the Omnius compatibility rules for cable, specific precondition and postcondition rules from cable are also evaluated within the Cable Rules Artifact. *With each change in the configurator (for cable products) the Omnius rules and Cable rules artifact are evaluated in a loop, until a stable state is reached.* |

As explained in the call (and in previous comments on this ticket):

the checkout is blocked by a rule that comes from the pcat because the product OMNIUSTVCHANGEDMARKER is not selected.
the product is added by the posting rules of the cable rules artifact if there is any change to the TV package
after the bundle is created the TV package is changed as it now contains VB4

The product itself however does not seem to indicate that it has a price nor a non standard rate, both of which should however not be necessary for unity inventory products.

It is noteworthy that the product itself has no price configured in the product setup, maybe the display in the contract summary of OSF does not work if it is an inventory product without a price (and without a non standard rate actually configured in the product setup)?

The very first analysis was by me and as far as I can tell nothing in the comments suggests that the assumptions I had were analysed?

For the result of my analysis see the first comment [OS-47333] OSF Wave 8.1 ACC2 - Contract Summary: Price of old TV Product is missing (only OSF) - Vodafone Global Jira.

I also checked again for a random customer having this product that the inventory returned by vkdgateway does indeed contain a price.

TL;DR:

This behaviour is reproducible with a vast range of PCAT versions (basically any version containing UMDKLM should suffice).

The product has no price configured, but for (unity) inventory products the price from the inventory must be used. 
VkdGateway correctly returns a price in the inventory of the customer.

We had a call with TechM team to analyse this defect Further and got the below information from them

They compared the back office configuration between one failed scenario(Digitaler Kabelanschluss m. Service ) and pass scenario(Digital Kabelanschluss)

and made the below changes to their environment to check whether it is working with failed scenario:

 

*1.They tried to change the price of the failed product and product frontend visibilty of the failed product same as the Passed one*

i.e They changed the price of Digitaler Kabelanschluss m. Service from 0 to 20,99 in BO and product Visibility as below (Previously only inverntory is selected for thiis product)

!image-2024-02-21-16-14-57-020.png|width=330,height=141!

And then when checked in front end , We are able to see the product details in front end 

 

*2. As we mentioned that price of the Unity Product should not be taken from Back Office*

To check this one , they tried to change one product price from 20,99 to 20 euros in back office in their environment 

When checked in front end , we are able to see the product price has changed from 20,99 to 20 Euros

!image-2024-02-21-16-20-15-601.png|width=718,height=118!

[~devi.jampana@vodafone.com] 

As discussed there is no such handling for this usecase; where Overriding of PCAT price with Customer Ibase for any product.

In Omnius; it always consider customer’s Ibase product price from pcat RMM(reverse Multimapped) or via (service all {{{}GetNonStandardRates{}}})

So this is not a defect ruther i would say it must be CR to have such behaviour handle in Omnius.

Multiple things are interesting for this order:
 # Natasa did select VP0 in the checkout, but it is missing from the order.
 ## while testing another bug we noticed that the technician options might not be added to the order when the agent selects them in the dropdown.
 # In the IBP VP0 is added to the order because of the rule ""add_VP0_for_ENV_NE4_technician_install_address"" which (among other things) checks 
{code:java}
object installation type is technician-install {code}
(which should correspond to the ""sehbereitschaft"" selected in the OSF checkout)
In contrast to
{code:java}
object availabilities contains self-install {code}
(which should correspond to the address property self-install)

 # If VP0 is not properly added by the dropdown in the checkout as well as not being selected by the rule due to the object installation type not being processed correctly then it might explain why OSF does send WTXN*:
The rule ""modem_mapping_for_new_customer_at_selfinstall_address"" applies either to

 ## new kip customers that select kip + tv without VP0/1V1

 ## new kip customer without tv

 # The first case would be taken by OSF, thus replacing WTX15 with WTXN15. while the IBP will take neither of them, thus not replacing WTX15

I think the first step must be that OSE must analyse why VP0 is not added to the shopping cart when selecting it in the dropdown.

Additionally no cable product logic seems to be executed after the value in the dropdown is selected for the whole rest of the order process, I was under the impression that at least before the checkout overview the cable product logic should be executed again. It would be nice if this could also be checked.

 ;;;","27/Sep/23 2:00 PM;nina.pickl@vodafone.com;pls check the last comment from Simon;;;","27/Sep/23 3:35 PM;simon.auch@vodafone.com;I am currently trying to reproduce it on a cloud sandbox to gain more insight what actually happens on OSF side, maybe [~natasa.dimovic1@vodafone.com] could rerun a testcase on an ACC environment with logging enabled as outlined on [How to get acc logs - Portals - Vodafone DE Confluence|https://de.confluence.agile.vodafone.com/display/PORTALS/How+to+get+acc+logs]?;;;","27/Sep/23 5:11 PM;simon.auch@vodafone.com;I tested this on one of our cloud sandboxes with v9.17.0-BB123 and cable PCAT V2301_2023_10_00_020 with the mock [Cable_Address_Availability_KIP500_SI.|https://ash-sb5-telesales.osf.paps-vf.de/agent/account/login?showProductCodes=true&TC_ID=Cable_Address_Availability_KIP500_SI]

Result: during the checkout I can select 1V1 as a TV technician and TECYESKIP as a KIP technician.
The logs indicate that 1V1 is never passed to cable product logic as selected.
I attached the log of the session.
[^cable_rules_artifact_OS44322.log]

The log should contain an entry like ""1V1|true"" which it does not.

I also reproduced the issue with the mock [Cable_Address_Type_NE4-VVO|https://ash-sb5-telesales.osf.paps-vf.de/agent/account/login?showProductCodes=true&TC_ID=Cable_Address_Type_NE4-VVO] which results in VP0 being selectable in the checkout. Again in the log we cannot find VP0 ever being passed to the cable product logic as selected.

[^cable_rules_artifact_OS44322_VP0.log]

At this point I think this is a OSF bug, since cable logic cannot control when and with which products it is called by OSF.;;;","29/Sep/23 2:20 PM;vikash.saurav@vodafone.com;h3. Kshitij Kumar Srivastava added a comment -

as the logs show the PCAT returns VP0 and 1V1 as visible in this case, so maybe we have a different understanding what ""visible"" in this case means?
My understanding of visible in this case is:
 * the last call of the cable rules plugin by osf returns a list of packages, each containing a list of products.
 * a product is ""visible"" for a dropdown if the property ""visible"" in the last return value of the cable rules plugin for this particular product was ""true"".

 ** this is especially distinct from the ""visibility"" of tariffs in the configurator which depends on more information like:
 *** is the product selected
 *** is it configured to be shown in the configurator
 *** is the product ""visible"" according to the last result of the cable rules plugin

*According to the logs 1V1/VP0 is visible in this case but is never selected by OSF even if the agent selects it in the dropdown*

This is even underlined by the fact that 1V1/VP0 are shown in the dropdown {*}which would not be the case if the were not ""visible""{*}.;;;","03/Oct/23 5:09 PM;dadasaheb.narbat@vodafone.com;Hi [~vikash.saurav@vodafone.com]  Could you please share latest update here and Chage status to InProgress. ;;;","05/Oct/23 1:15 PM;vikash.saurav@vodafone.com;h3.

Please clarify with [~simon.auch@vodafone.com] Thank you;;;","10/Oct/23 3:58 PM;simon.auch@vodafone.com;The cause for the skyticket or the cable backend error is the missing VP0/1V1 product. This is missing because, according to our investigation, the product is never passed to the cable product logic in OSF, even if the corresponding dropdown is selected in the OSF checkout.

Hi [~vikash.saurav@vodafone.com] ,
thank you for the investigation.
According to our investigation we do not have any Compatibility Rules that deselect 1V1, and as said before 1V1 also never appears in the input to the cable rules plugin. 
Also check this previous comment for a log: https://jira.sp.vodafone.com/browse/OS-44322?focusedId=2949361&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels:comment-tabpanel#comment-2949361

As things stand there is nothing cable logic can do to deselect the product as the product is never select from the point of view of the cable product logic.

Please investigate on your side why 1V1 is never passed to CREP as selected once it is selected in the shopping cart/checkout.

Best regards

Hi [~simon.auch@vodafone.com]  ,

This issue on Sky or Cable backend we talking above may be related to CR676. Check with VF as we don't have any implementation on OSE for CR676.

Also we have some discussions going on for CR676 with on [OS-44236] SIT1 | Retail/Telesales | CR676 | Cable order is failing with error JSON validation failure - Vodafone Global Jira

[~natasa.dimovic1@vodafone.com] fyi;;;","11/Oct/23 2:53 PM;simon.auch@vodafone.com;Hi Vikash,

I do not think it is related to CR676 as it has nothing to do with the json schema, but a change in that CR could of course have impacted OSE to behave differently. According to my knowledge however CR676 only had OGW impact until recently and should have no impact whatsoever on OSE and with which products OSE calls the cable product logic.

As I said before, from our perspective there is absolutely nothing cable can do about this *because we do not control with which products cable product logic is called by from OSE.*

*Please investigate in OSE why the cable product logic is not called with the product after it is selected in the checkout.* Before this is done there will be nothing we can do to help with this issue, so please refrain to assigning it back to me before this is investigated. If you have further question please set up a meeting with me.

Best regards

Hi [~natasa.dimovic1@vodafone.com] 

As already mentioned you that this defect we have fixed on the rule level where the 1V1 was not sent as selected true. After fix this is sent as selected true to Cable artifact rule. Next Cable artifact process the input and send back final list which should be present in cart.

This can be verified by enabled Cable artifact rules on ACC and verify that 1V1 is sent on rules input for the package or not.

We can verify If we are sending 1V1 as true or false on artifact rule log file. If sending as true then plugin has to return the selected product back to OSE to keep that file in cart.

Please check and confirm;;;","09/Nov/23 5:41 PM;natasa.dimovic1@vodafone.com;Hi [~simon.auch@vodafone.com] could you please check the last comment?

the problem only seems to appear for addresses that allow 1V1 (instead of VP0).
One such address: Hagelstangestr. 30, München;;;","06/Dec/23 8:20 PM;simon.auch@vodafone.com;I further analysed this issue and found the following:

Orders created by OSF contain a field 
{code:json}
""apartmentDetails"":{""technicianNeeded"":
true/false
}
{code}
As far as I can tell from tests the field is always true if and only if the agent selected the technician_yes option in either the TV or the KIP dropdown during the checkout.

This information should also be passed to the cable rules plugin, in the field `IServiceAddress::technicianNeeded`.

After the selection of technician options in the dropdown the cable posting rules are executed again by OSF, but the the `technicianNeeded` field is not set to true (as it should be if the agent previously selected VP0/TECYESKIP in the technician dropdowns).

This can be checked by searching for `technicianNeeded` in the following log: [^cable_rules_artifact_OS44322_technicianNeeded.log] 
Notice that the last execution contains `TECYESKIP|true`, since the agent selected the kip technician to be necessary.

For fixing this bug the cable rules artifact logs can be used to check if the technician needed flag is passed to the cable rules plugin correctly.
In the meantime we will try to provide a workaround that might resolve most of the issues as well. We have an experimental workaround since version V2330_2024_01_00_032.
Until this issue is fixed on OSF side and we can remove our workaround again I would keep this ticket open however.;;;","15/Dec/23 3:43 PM;dadasaheb.narbat@vodafone.com;hi [~vikash.saurav@vodafone.com]  Please share latest update here. ;;;","18/Dec/23 11:18 AM;dadasaheb.narbat@vodafone.com;HI [~vikash.saurav@vodafone.com]  Please share latest update here. ;;;","28/Dec/23 6:42 PM;ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com;We have to check if mentioned workaround from Simon is present on ACC environment (and on which environment)

Okay, let me go through your message step by step.

For the first test case:
 * I can reproduce it :)
 * I think that only the TV dropdown is shown is correct (according to the up to now still best documentation we have: [Scenario dimension ""Technician appointment"" - OSF - Vodafone Global Confluence|https://confluence.sp.vodafone.com/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=103985437]).
 * I think VP0 being selectable is also correct (again according to above documentation, and to some tests we have [Quelle von vkdTechnicianOptions.feature - productSetup - webgit (kabeldeutschland.de)|https://webgit.kabeldeutschland.de/projects/FE/repos/productsetup/browse/4DevelopmentOnly/tests/unified/features/availability/vkdTechnicianOptions.feature#216-236]).
 * VP0 disappearing afterwards sounds problematic and without investigating I have no idea why it would.
 ** VP0 not being selected anymore however explains that my workaround doesn't work because it relied on the presence of the technician options instead of the flag.

For the second case:
 * I can reproduce the behaviour :)
 * I don't understand the problem with this though? For this particular example you can proceed either with no technician at all (TECNOKIP, TECNOTV are both selectable) or with a technician (TECYESKIP, 1V1 can be selected together).
 * If the issue is the error message, what would be the expected behaviour if a different technician selection would be made by the agent?
 * If the issue is that the TV dropdown is visible at all: that confuses me a bit as well, since our tests would indicate that only the kip options should be shown in this case: [Quelle von vkdTechnicianOptions.feature - productSetup - webgit (kabeldeutschland.de)|https://webgit.kabeldeutschland.de/projects/FE/repos/productsetup/browse/4DevelopmentOnly/tests/unified/features/availability/vkdTechnicianOptions.feature#239-259]

The answer why the whole section is missing can only be given by OSF.

If I had to guess I would assume OSF is hardcoded to check for TECYESKIP, TECNOKIP, UMTECKIP:NOO, UMTECKIP:YES. One of the relevant tests in our test suite is likely:
{code:java}
    Scenario: New cable TV (KAA) and KIP customer without self-install on NE4-VVO address
        Given a KDG service address where ""analog and digital"" TV is available with object category ""NE4-VVO""
        And a KDG service address where internet with data transfer rate ""1000"" is available
        And self-install is 'not available'
        And a selection
            | productCode |
            | TC2         |
            | 01H:B06     |
        When I get the availability and basket
        Then the products have the states
            | productCode  | state         |
            | TC2          | selected      |
            | 01H:B06      | selected      |
            | TECNOKIP     | not available |
            | TECYESKIP    | not available |
            | TECNOTV      | not available |
            | TECYESTV     | not available |
            | VP0          | selectable    |
            | 1V1          | not available |
            | UMTECKIP:NOO | not available |
            | UMTECKIP:YES | not available | {code}
According to my understanding no kip technician is needed at VVO addresses since the TV technician will handle the installation.
As with the other bug tickets I think we need clarification from business what the expected behaviour is.

Thank you!;;;","21/Sep/23 1:42 PM;simon.auch@vodafone.com;Hi Natasa, just for my understanding: what is the impact of not booking VP0?
As far as I understand the relevant BI order for TV is created anyway, right?
It's just that the customer might not get an information on the CS/confirmation letter that a technician will be sent out?

I think this is a cable bug, [~benjamin.sachse@vodafone.com] can you prioritize this in our backlog?;;;","21/Sep/23 1:49 PM;natasa.dimovic1@vodafone.com;Hi [~simon.auch@vodafone.com] yes, I think the only impact is, that the customer does not see this information in the CS. I'm not sure if it is also an impact, that ANS is not booked, if VP0 is booked. If VP0 would be booked, then ANS is also booked.

 ;;;","21/Sep/23 5:30 PM;simon.auch@vodafone.com;*Guess:* 
Cable product logic tries to rebuild the selection of the agent in each step. This means that certain clickflows are not really supported.

If their are for example two products A and B, A is visible, B is not, selecting A replaces A with B.
If the agent now selects A, A will be added to the selection and the product logic will replace it with B, the agent will see B in the selection.
If the cable product logic is executed again B is not a valid selection because it is not visible.

In this case A would be VP0, and B would be 1V1.

I do not think that there is a simple fix for this issue if my guess is correct.

The two options I see:
 # do not restrict the visibility of VP0 in this case
 ** this would imply that the agent could directly select VP0
 ** since VP0 and 1V1 are mapped to the same dropdown option in OSF -> the agent can only select VP0 together with 1V1, the replacement of 1V1 with VP0 then actually just removes 1V1 since VP0 is already selected.
 # maybe 1V1 should not be selectable in the first place
 ** instead of allowing the agent to select 1V1 which will automatically be replaced with VP0 allow the agent to select VP0 directly instead.

*Open questions:*

Which option is preferred by business?
 * if option 2 is preferred: should this also applied to other portals

What exactly are the affected cases? 
 * likely all test cases where the rule that replaces 1V1 with VP0 applies. 
 * Can business confirm that all cases affected by the rule below should be changed with either option 1 or 2?
 * The rule is: 

{code:java}
Rule 'Replace_1V1_with_VP0_when_ordering_KAI':
When
    selected products contain '1V1' and
    condition 'new_kip_order' applies and
    condition 'digitalSelected' applies
then
    deselect '1V1' and
    select 'VP0' with contract relation set to the main analog product. {code}
 ;;;","27/Sep/23 2:10 PM;nina.pickl@vodafone.com;As agreed yesterday, the issue will be discussed by the Ash team with Christian Lienbacher, regarding the expectations from a business perspective.;;;","27/Sep/23 6:46 PM;fabian.keilbach@vodafone.com;Analysis by Team Ash so far:
 * In case the scenario is reproduced as outlined in the ticket none of 1V1 or VP0 ever gets in the selection of the Cable Rules Plugin even when 1V1 is selected in the frontend
 * In case of ONLY booking TV (no KIP), we can select 1V1 in the frontend as expected and also see it in our Cable Rules Plugin logs 

We thus are lead to believe this is a problem of the frontend not putting the correct (or any) product in the selection in the defect case and therefore require a retest by techM in the following manner
 * Scenario to be reproduced shall be the flow described as steps to reproduce in the ticket
 * Cable logging enabled as in below image:

We did our analysis together with @Timo Hurai on OSE side and found the problematic checkout product 1V1 is not allowed after Processing of post cable rules. Below are the list of products which are allowed as part of cart after saving change provider details.
 
 {{=== THE FOLLOWING PRODUCTS SHOULD BE PRESENT IN CART AFTER CABLE POST CONDITION: CKH8, SN3, MFT, KH8, CD5, DH5, HDC:000, DV2:T02, TC2, DCX, SC, TOEVN, 9I0:B00, HO1:000, PC1:B01, AO0, FM4:B00, VSA, PAS, 01H:B06, OF5:B00, 69K, V3G, V3K, MTV, WTX21, 3K6, TECYESKIP, KIPOPENEDMARKER}}
First before post cable rules processing the product we added into cart please find below screenshot

!image-2023-10-05-13-08-57-210.png!

But after some seconds once the Post cable rules processing happened we removed the product becuase its not part of allowed list.
 
 {{=== REMOVED FROM CART PROD WITH SKU: 1V1 ===}}
Please find attached screenshot from DB after post processing of cable rules.

!image-2023-10-05-13-09-30-710.png!

For Cable packages we don’t compatibility rules on OSE side, addition / deletion of cable products from cart depend on Cable Pre/Post rules. Kindly assign back this with above information and also I am attaching the CableOmniusRules.log where we can find the details of on same.

[^CableOmniusRules.log];;;","05/Oct/23 6:06 PM;simon.auch@vodafone.com;Hi [~vikash.saurav@vodafone.com] ,
thank you for the investigation.
According to our investigation we do not have any Compatibility Rules that deselect 1V1, and as said before 1V1 also never appears in the input to the cable rules plugin. 
For completeness we attach the log of the cable rules plugin so you can check for yourself that 1V1 is never passed to the cable product logic as selected: [^cable_rules_artifact372637.log] 

When working with the log searching for ""1V1|true"" and ""1V1|false"" returns the corresponding input state of the product. You will find that no entry exist for ""1V1|true"".

As things stand there is nothing cable logic can do to deselect the product as the product is never select from the point of view of the cable product logic.

Please investigate on your side why 1V1 is never passed to CREP as selected once it is selected in the shopping cart (as seen in one of your screenshots).

Hi [~natasa.dimovic1@vodafone.com] 

As already mentioned you that this defect we have fixed on the rule level where the 1V1 was not sent as selected true. After fix this is sent as selected true to Cable artifact rule. Next Cable artifact process the input and send back final list which should be present in cart.

This can be verified by enabled Cable artifact rules on ACC and verify that 1V1 is sent on rules input for the package or not.

We can verify If we are sending 1V1 as true or false on artifact rule log file. If sending as true then plugin has to return the selected product back to OSE to keep that file in cart

 

Please check and confirm ;;;","09/Nov/23 5:39 PM;natasa.dimovic1@vodafone.com;Hi [~simon.auch@vodafone.com] could you please check the last comment? Thank you;;;","13/Nov/23 3:54 PM;simon.auch@vodafone.com;Hi [~natasa.dimovic1@vodafone.com],
I can confirm that 1V1 is now passed to the product logic, which I think removes it because no TV technician is needed (due to kip no self install).
Is this still a major bug, given that the correct technician orders in BI are created as far as I understand the ticket?

The error message “Service PIN ist bei diesem Kunden nicht vorhanden” is displayed when Omnius gets the GET Call response from DXL with error code 404.

Hi [~natasa.dimovic1@vodafone.com] 

,As we verify the getcustomersearchresposne of both index search and legacy search we see,

Index search,,We receive 2 customer results one with cable and one with mobile, Hence you don’t see the SPIN message

as it is applicable for cable only

!image-2024-02-09-12-06-25-114.png!

Now when you did legacy search, the response had only cable and there was no mobile customer returned

hence it is cable only ,SPIN is applicable here and we show the message.

Hi Natasa,

When we search a cable customer ,the getCustomerResponse has below result which is indicating that it's linked customer but has only cable details from OGW, You see *NO* other stack data, Hence OSF considers this as a cable customer and sends a get request for indices to DXL (as service PIN is applicable)

but we get no indices from DXL ,so we have to fallback to standard authentication with an error message.

maybe we need to set up a call again.

this is what i can see from the requests:

 Not a valid defect toward Omnius.

CR716 ILS is not in scope. suggest to invistegate with VF Cable team for cable rulez plugin.
Note : *Technician needed* OR *SelfInstallation* dropdown options visiblity and respective product in SC logic is exisitng and controlled via cable rulez plugin.

In CR716
(ABK = Yes or No) and *YES* has only scope if there is *Technician needed* dropdown option possible then make this option preset in readonly AND also not add chargeable product in SC.

Can you please look into the below comment

 

Regards

Srujana;;;","20/Sep/23 4:07 PM;simon.auch@vodafone.com;This can be changed on cable side, but I am relatively sure that this was never implemented for Unity.

Without CR-716 the agent could select both ""Anschluss ist bereits sehbereit"" or ""Anschluss ist nicht sehbereit"" but only ""Anschluss ist bereits sehbereit"" would actually do anything (selecting a marker product).

With CR-716 only the option with a valid product selection is left, but functionally everything behaves just like before.
The agent basically just had the illusion of a choice before.

If this behaviour should be changed I think it needs to be clarified if there are other cases for unity in which (at a self install address) the option ""Anschluss ist nicht sehbereit"" should be selectable. The other ES* products come to mind for example.;;;","22/Sep/23 4:50 PM;nina.pickl@vodafone.com;In clarification:

the technician option should be shown if KIP only is booked or is there an exception when booking ES5? If yes, then I would say the wrong option is displayed.

as I understood it, the technician section should never be shown for a KIP-only booking.

In the excel sheet, there are only 2 cases left in which we want to show the section in OSF, which are both TV-only cases.
!image-2025-02-03-08-44-34-740.png|width=1339,height=527!

For this use case, described in the description, the technician option is still displayed in the Access Details.

We are not sure if everything has already been implemented.

If everything has already been implemented then I would suggest to reject this bug. A new bug should be created then. Could you please check if there is maybe a bug on Cable side? Thank you;;;","03/Feb/25 1:33 PM;tobias.pohlmann@vodafone.com;Ah, okay, now I get it.

The target 20090213 is defined as DEFAULT, not DEFAULT OBLIGATED.
But even though, the product 20090213 cannot be deselected.
The software team must fix this issue, so the target product 20090213 is going to be put into shopping cart as default, but could be deselected anytime by agent if necessary.

*To reproduce this error:
===============*
Software version: any

Test stub: see attached file [^FN_ILS_FTTH_DTAG.zip] 
Log file: see attached file [^rules_debug_step3_selectHardware7590.log]

Step on OSF GUI 
============
1. search customer, any string
2. click on ""Paket Ändern"" change package
3. select a DTAG tarif
4. select any hardware which is not Fritzbox 5590

You would get below window, and the product 20090213 is not deselectable:

Hi [~shuyan.luo@vodafone.com]  ,

Based on the code investigation, it appears that this is not a issue, the manual_override_allowed field value is 0 in the catalog_package_subtypes table which is why its not allowing to deselect the hardware.

When the PCAT files are imported, the values of this field are set according to the values available in the PCAT files, so if the PCAT file does not contain this filed value for any stack, the value is considered to be 0.

When the manual_override_allowed field is set to 1 for a fixed stack, then the hardware can be deselected in the configurator according to the value in the manual_override_allowed field.

!image-2023-11-10-12-33-31-352.png!;;;","10/Nov/23 4:45 PM;shuyan.luo@vodafone.com;The attribute manual_override_allowed delete too much, so it couldn't be used as workaroud to fix our issue.

We identified the root cause of this issue and suggested to have mutual override allow enabled for sub package having these hardwares. but this was causing some other issues which i discussed with Marco and Shuyan.

I am trying with existing expression to fix this issue if not then next step would be to have a new expression which will override the logix written for mutual exclusive categories.

can you provide on which information it depends whether or not OSF displays the access details for TV and for KIP?
If this depends on certain product states it would be valuable to know for example which products, which property of this product etc.
If this depends on certain address properties it would be important to know on which address properties like tags, flags, etc.

It would be perfect if you could provide this information for both software versions on the ACC1 (v9.16.6-BB1) and the ACC2 (v9.17.0-BB46).

thank you for providing the examples, but I was hoping for the actual decisions OSF makes in order to determine whether or not to show the access details during the checkout.
Examples are in this case not sufficient to correctly determine the severity of the problem. 
After knowing the decisions OSF makes I would for example want to be able to now if OSF shows the access details if the cable product logic returns TECNOTV, TECYESTV, 1V1 as not visible, and VP0 as visible.

According to the answer from [~vikash.saurav@vodafone.com]  https://jira.sp.vodafone.com/browse/OS-42115?focusedId=2910953&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels:comment-tabpanel#comment-2910953 the display of the tv access details depends on the availability of the products TECNOTV and TECYESTV reported by the cable logic.

*Why does the workaround work?*

My *assumption* is that OSF remembers the availability of TECNOTV and/or TECYESTV from a previous execution of the cable logic.

If KIP is selected first, then the first executions of the cable product logic will return TECNOTV and TECYESTV as not available. 

If TV is selected first, then the first executions of the cable product logic will return either TECNOTV and/or TECYESTV as available.

-> This is something that has to be fixed by OSF

{*}What is the implication of the Workaround?{*}{*}{{*}}

Assuming cable product logic would return TECNOTV or TECYESTV as bookable the issue might persist in OSF, since as long as KIP is selected first TECNOTV and TECYESTV will still not be available from the start.

*Open questions from my perspective:*
 * which products exactly control the display of the tv access details in OSF?
 ** Is it only TECYESTV and TECNOTV or also products like VP0, 1V1?
 ** Is this controlled by special tags on products or categories, or are the products hardcoded in OSF?
Maybe [~vikash.saurav@vodafone.com] can answer this question?
 *  in which scenarios should which technician option be bookable in OSF?

 * 
 ** we have a list of ~80 test cases. Some of these are apparently not correct.
 ** Who can go through these test cases with us and determine which of them need to be changed?
 ** Without at least a contact person that can answer this question it will not make sense to start implementation of this ticket.

Following is the answer to the query to show Access details or New connection section for KIP and Kable TV.

For the section to be visible, the cable artifact result must contain at least one product matching the option types.

technician_needed_no 
technician_needed_yes

If there is no result for those options, the section will not be displayed.

Hello [~simon.auch@vodafone.com] , Please find the details below.

It is hard to give an exact timing for this feature since it seems to have been implemented a long time ago. I recommend contact with Vodafone BA for more information.
Unity Media works exactly the same as normal Kable TV and KIP products to display the access details section.

so, PORPDT-345 will not make this requirement obsolete, it will just slightly shift how it looks.

The new requirements are: if only TV is ordered, show the section. If TV + Internet is ordered, don't show it.

The new problem is this:
If the agent books the packages in the following order
 * TV
 * KIP

then the TV accessibility section is shown, but it should not.

The problem is still the same as described by [~simon.auch@vodafone.com] in the comment from 21/Sep/2023: 
OSF seems only to decide on whether to show the accessibility section for TV when the TV package is opened. So,
 * we first open TV and book a TV Connect ---> OSF sees that 1V1 and TECNOTV are available and correctly assumes that it should show the TV accessibility section
 * we then open the internet section and book some GigaZuhause tariff ---> from now on, 1V1 and TECNOTV are not available anymore, but OSF seems to not update its opinion on the TV accessibility and will display it anyway
 * IF the user just simply opens the TV package again (without changing anything), OSF updates again and will correctly NOT display it

This is something we cannot fix and still need a change from OSF.;;;","13/Jun/24 3:31 PM;ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com;[~tobias.pohlmann@vodafone.com]  I am not able to get your comment

Thank you for the re-test.

The failure in case 2, where the technician option for KIP is wrongly displayed, is again the OSF bug discussed further below:
- when you book KIP first, then OSF calculates the technician option it wants to show for KIP, which is for a pure KIP order on an self-install address currently ""Anschluss ist sehbereit"".

- when you then book TV, it will not update the technician option it wants to show for KIP, and just show it regardless.

- when you just simply open the KIP package after the TV selection again, OSF _will_ update its opinion and not show the KIP technician section.

We cannot do anything here on our side and would need a fix from TechM side, so that OSF will always update both the TV and KIP technician section, no matter which package is currently opened.

 

About the ""Verbindungsdaten speichern"" field I don't know much unfortunately --neither how it is controlled nor what the desired logic behind it is.;;;","01/Jul/24 7:53 PM;ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com;[~tobias.pohlmann@vodafone.com]  we see a mismatch in behavior in case we book Broadvision KIP or different KIP 

For broadvision KIP its working as described by Timo Russo


Book BV KIP first, then TV -> section for technician is not displayed ->  {color:#00875a}*OK*{color}
Book other KIP first, then TV -> section for technician is displayed -> {color:#de350b}*NOT OK*{color}

{color:#de350b}*Can you confirm that for other KIP then BV also section for technician should be removed?*

{color:#172b4d}Its not about booking TV first, and then KIP. We handle this use case separately, we are aware that there might be an issue.
*But for now we only want to understand the behavior for  [[PORPDT-345]|https://de.jira.agile.vodafone.com/browse/PORPDT-345]*{color};;;","02/Jul/24 3:06 PM;tobias.pohlmann@vodafone.com;Hi, Ariadne,

{*}{color:#de350b}yes, I can confirm that in any case where we book KIP + TV (no matter if Broadvision or not, no matter which order we book it in), no technician section should be shown{color}{*}. 

The reason why this fails is as I tried to point out in my comment below. It really is pretty confusing, I apologize for that. I had a call with Natasa where I explained the problem, because it really is a bit hard to grasp.

So again in case of Broadvision what happens is:
 - [In the KIP package] KIP is booked, TV Connect is added because of Broadvision ---> OSF understands that no section for KIP should be shown because KIP + TV is booked and remembers that

 - [In the TV package] TV Digital is booked ---> OSF understands that no section for TV should be shown because KIP+TV is booked

==> no KIP or TV technician section is shown

In case of Not-Broadvision:
 - [In the KIP package] Only KIP is booked, but not TV yet ----> OSF supposes that a technician section should be shown for KIP (because only KIP is booked) and remembers that
 - [In the TV package] TV Digital + TV Connect is booked ----> OSF understands that no section for TV should be shown because KIP+TV is booked, but doesn't update the reasoning for KIP

==> technician section is shown for KIP, but not for TV;;;","09/Jul/24 5:42 PM;natasa.dimovic1@vodafone.com; ** There was a change on PCAT side: [[PORPDT-345] BV - Removal of Ready-to-Watch (Sehbereitschaft) Section - DE Jira (vodafone.com)|https://de.jira.agile.vodafone.com/browse/PORPDT-345]

*Open questions from my perspective:*
 * which products exactly control the display of the tv access details in OSF?
 ** Is it only TECYESTV and TECNOTV or also products like VP0, 1V1?
 ** Is this controlled by special tags on products or categories, or are the products hardcoded in OSF?
Maybe [~vikash.saurav@vodafone.com] can answer this question?
 * If the display of the checkout part is only controlled by TECYESTV and TECNOTV, this will not work (and from cable side never should have) for Unity, since these two products are not aligned and should never be available for Unity.
Which TV technician option should be bookable in Unity TV scenarios? As far as I am aware there is no TV technician product that is available in the Unity footprint.
 *  in which scenarios should which technician option be bookable in OSF?

 * 
 ** we have a list of ~80 test cases. Some of these are apparently not correct.

If we are following the below steps in ACC2 then we are able to see the Access details even now:

Steps:

1)select TV Product and KIP section 

2)select the TV Product

3)Donot select any product in KIP

4)Move forward it will throw an error that we have to select the KIP Product in check out section

5)Go back and select the KIP Product now

6)Move forward and fill customer details

7)Then we are able to see the access details for TV

Note:we tried this steps 3 to 4 times and we are able to see the access details once

[~devi.jampana@vodafone.com] for now I would ignore the case you had and focus on the scenario described in the ticket: a TV order without KIP.
I think my initial question is still unanswered:
When does OSF show the access details section for TV in a unity scenario?

If the answer to this question is ""when at least one product in the technician_needed_no or technician_needed_yes category is visible according to the cable product logic"" then the next question we need answered is why was the section shown in previous versions?

[~nina.pickl@vodafone.com] could you figure out a version where this worked last time?;;;","28/Sep/23 8:18 PM;simon.auch@vodafone.com;According to an answer from Vikash in another ticket [OS-42115] OSF | ACC2 | Wave 8.1 | CR716 Futurize regression defect | when booking KIP and TV the access details for TV are not displayed - Vodafone Global Jira
""It is hard to give an exact timing for this feature since it seems to have been implemented a long time ago. I recommend contact with Vodafone BA for more information.
Unity Media works exactly the same as normal Kable TV and KIP products to display the access details section."".
To me this is a direct conflict to the information that this ever worked in the (recent) past.
Without a specific version in which it worked before I have the feeling this discussing is not leading anywhere.

If we want to change this we need a requirement from Business regarding which tv technician options to align for unity or accept that the tv access details are not shown in unity cases.;;;","29/Sep/23 12:27 PM;nina.pickl@vodafone.com;Hi [~simon.auch@vodafone.com],

Could you please check that

 ;;;","17/Oct/23 3:05 PM;simon.auch@vodafone.com;Hi Devi,

I have no clue what OSF is doing here, but definitely not how it should behave to the best of my knowledge.
I could reproduce the issue and make the following two screenshots:
!image-2023-10-17-11-31-41-319.png!
!image-2023-10-17-11-32-04-497.png!

Which shows that OSF thinks that 1V1/VP0/TECYESTV/TECNOTV should be selected. That is not correct since the last execution of the cable product logic up to that point in the checkout process returns none of these 4 products as visible.
For completeness I attached the log of the session up to the dropdown in the checkout: [^cable_rules_artifact_OS42066.log]

Please find out when the access details are shown in the checkout. All information until now seems to conflict with the unity case. Maybe there is a special handling for unity addresses hardcoded in OSF?;;;","19/Oct/23 11:57 AM;ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com;Hi [~simon.auch@vodafone.com]  

regarding ""All information until now seems to conflict with the unity case"" -> for CR716 we have raised also defects for VKD and not only for Unity, so something is in general wrong in this access details section.

As the latest observation happened after having new broadvision product catalogue in place, should we raise a defect against CR756? Or against Product catalogue?
I do not want to mix this defect here with behavior shown for broadvision products, otherwise will be even more confusing;;;","19/Oct/23 1:20 PM;simon.auch@vodafone.com;Hi Ariadne,
maybe it was not clear what I meant with ""All information until now seems to conflict with the unity case"":
 * We have multiple answers (in this ticket and in other tickets) saying that TECNOTV and TECYESTV control the display of the section (and did so in the past)

 * 
 ** this can't be the case for unity as those are not aligned products
 * In other answers it was mentioned that it is controlled not by TECNOTV and TECYESTV but by categories containing TECNOTV, TECYESTV, 1V1, VP0
 ** sound better, but also all of these products are not aligned and should never have been orderable for unity

In the newly encountered behaviour by Devi (https://jira.sp.vodafone.com/browse/OS-42066?focusedId=2974883&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels:comment-tabpanel#comment-2974883) suddenly the access details are shown. Even though TECNOTV , TECYESTV, VP0, and 1V1 are not bookable according to cable product logic?

Someone has to look into the OSE source code and check _systematically_ when this section is shown. I expect there to be _something_ hardcoded for VFW, but I cannot check that myself.

Without an explanation from OSE side when this section is shown I don't know how else to help with this defect. If it is supposed to be based on the orderability of specific categories {_}then the new behaviour is a OSE contradicts it because no product from that category is orderable in the scenario clicked by me{_}. So for starters this could be analysed and maybe we get some insight which logic we are missing from OSE.  

I would not open another defect for this observation.;;;","23/Oct/23 5:21 PM;ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com;we have agreed that general analysis of CR716 defects regarding installation logic is required.

As part of implementation of Z_SRT02126640A(enhancements in plm process logging) a check was added that based on logfile name it was determined if we are in a auto-import scenario. This was not a correct implementation since for auto import we are triggering the plm.php job with stack=Auto. Then after checking the files which are missing we are internally triggering the process again with i.e. stack=Mobile ( incase mobile is missing). The name of the logfile doesnt change, this resulted in attempting to do the autoimport file comparison again, however this time it fails since we didnt retrieve the files. Hence the autoimport fails.

TLDR: Z_SRT02126640A broke it.;;;","27/Mar/23 5:14 PM;ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com;This change Z_SRT02126640A was deployed to ACC in October 2022 with CN_17082  
I think the last test with CR498 active was some months before that timeframe and we did not know, that this change has effect on CR498. 

 

However, I think we would need an improvement in CR498 functionality right?

I think there are only two options:

2) A new change is set up to correct CR498 functionality?

ACtually I am not sure what this fix here was about - we did not deploy it because we were running out of time. So not sure if this fix was already one of the options. Please check with TechM and let us know the next steps.
Please keep in mind we have to plan a new separate test slot for it.

Migration team can be helpful here. MRT is designed in discussion with them and Legacy Ids are maintained the way it is agreed upon.

As far as i know, at Customer service desk, UM Customer is always asked the Region/state they come from.

ali;;;","15/Dec/22 8:01 PM;heike.eisenlohr1@vodafone.com;I think this bug was created when we did not receive any status updates due to some misconfiguration in the weborder DB. We fixed that configuration issue on Nov 8 (WeborderDBRelease 2190.2022.11.00.03). 
Since then it should work, also for manually approved orders since the weborder ID should be sufficient to get an order status.
Does the error still occur? If yes, do you have example orders? ;;;","16/Dec/22 2:06 PM;ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com;as per latest Discussion with Daniel, the customer ID is relevant to get the status. But for manual approved orders the customer id is not available in a short time. But if helpful we can create another order.... it would be great if issue is solved, because it is there since months.
At the same time we received order status completed for all orders which got auto approved.

 

[~singireddy.reddy@vodafone.com]  can you please create a new customer order on ACC1 for unitymedia which would force manual approval? You can place an order on an adress where the same IBAN is already used, and same customer name. Then it will come to manual approval.

Created 2 orders that went into manual.
We got them approved, one as a new customer order, one as an existing customer order. (this doesn't change the status, it remains open)
We got them closed (this changes the status)
The status closed was picked up by the UOTracker and is also visible from OSF (This means that we didn't find a bug)

Our current best guess from looking at the screenshots is that: in that case the order was only approved and not closed and as such the order status didn't change, so there was nothing to show in OSF.;;;","11/May/23 4:47 PM;ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com;[~singireddy.reddy@vodafone.com]  can you please run one test case again on ACC1 with manual approval?

Step 1: Once the order is transferred to the backend, order should be in progress in ordermanager

Step 1: Complete the order (execute as new customer order) and check if it gets completed in frontend order manager

Please check as well if the customer id is transferred back to OSF

You can share the feedback here and also connect with Miklos

So to me it looks like the UnityOrderTracker correctly retrieves an update from Unity and sends it to VkdGateway which correctly sends it to OGW which {*}returns a result indicating success{*}.

Very long time ago I already mentioned that I assume we are not getting back the real customer ID and therefore we do not get the status completed

1) in case the order is auto approved, we immediately get back the customer ID from unity backend, and it works fine

2) in case the order is manual approved after some time, somehow a second ""update"" is missing, which would return the customer ID 

But through all the discussions it was stated it should not be a problem in this area. I still feel that this gap is somewhere in this process.

so after the meeting today we agree that we need to check with Cable why OGW is not getting customer id in any of the set order status.
this is the reason why oneDMS call is failing.;;;","27/Nov/23 4:28 PM;ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com;The discussion in the beginning of this defect and my understanding all the time:

In case order is auto approved, customer ID is immediately given back to VKD Gateway
In Case order is NOT auto approved but later manually, there is no new call to get the customer ID -> thats why its not available

But in between it was mentioned that this is not the issue - as its working for retail, its strange that not working for Telesales.

Please note that OneDMS is handling Telesales Unity like VKD for Contract Summary Archiving. Not sure if relevant.

After investigation with Nina and Rohan , 

We got the information that for Auto approval orders we can see the customer number and Unified Order ID ,so success status is reflecting in OSF

But for Manual approval orders, Customer id is not available in logs and also Unified Order ID is missing and Action is getting skipped

Hi All,
Thank you all for joining the call!!
 
Please find the final Action points below from our call today:
 
	1. [~nina.pickl@vodafone.com] and [~rohan.kumbhar@vodafone.com] have discussed with [~simon.auch@vodafone.com] regarding this defect.
	
Action Point:

	1. [~nina.pickl@vodafone.com] will check with [~ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com] and update the defect. If required then CR will be raised.


;;;","07/Dec/23 1:51 PM;nina.pickl@vodafone.com;Updates:

 

OGW needs the customer number in case Unity Manual Approval Orders in Telesales and Retails, which should be provided from VKD to OGW within the existing FulfillmentStarted Request.

 

The customer number is atm provided only for Auto Approval Orders, but missing for Manual Approval orders, therefore the document cannot be archived and the OGW processing remain in status pending (the VKD status is SUCCESS but the orders don't get Sucecss status in OSF Fronend):

An error was encountered while invoking ScanView-SaveDocument WS. Details [Error_Code: HTTPOutbound_0001, Error_Message: Received a fault from processing server for service '/ScanView-001/SaveDocument': An invalid number format or number value was encountered.

Note: Retail Manual Approval Orders don't have this issue because the call to oneDMS/Customernumber is not needed for the E2E flow. They get the Status Success.

 

As the customer number has not been sent for Manual Approval Order until now, a new PST change is required.

I will take the topic with me and check if we can request this change at the PST CAT train, Team Ash(Benjamin Sachse) or Nora.

 

The new requirement should contain following information:
 * no difference between retail and telesales from cable perspective
 * example set status messages received by OSF
 * fulfilment started from manual approval 
 * fulfilment started from automatic approval 


 * explanation on
 * what you clicked to create the manual approval order
 * how to approve the manual approval order

Will update here once it is clear how to process with the new change.;;;","18/Dec/23 3:04 PM;nina.pickl@vodafone.com;In Progress by PST Ash Team, corresponding Jira Ticket in PST Jira:

[~simon.auch@vodafone.com] 

Elango performed the same flow on the both environments ACC1/test2b and ACC2/test3b- on ACC2/test3b worked fine, but not on ACC1/test2b.

Can you please check if the fix is available on test2b or what can be the reason otherwise?

 ;;;","01/Feb/24 4:26 PM;simon.auch@vodafone.com;So, the obvious difference between test3b (working) and test2b (not working) is that on test3b the status update is a `COMPLETED_SUCCESS` while on the test2b it is a `IN_PROGRESS_FULFILLMENT_STARTED`.

It can be seen that the unity order tracker on the test2b does not trigger any more updates for the order after the one with the status OPEN (for which we already have a customer ID as seen in the log).

I checked the test2b database contains the UME_ORDER_STATUS 'COMPLETED', which is correct, but apparently not written by the unity order tracker. Maybe there is a race condition between the unity order tracker and some other service that tries to write this field? This would also explain why it only happens sometimes.;;;","01/Feb/24 4:47 PM;nina.pickl@vodafone.com;[~elango.durairaj@vodafone.com]  Can you please check if the test2b order was successfully approved AND closed in Unity Backend?

 

Thanks [~simon.auch@vodafone.com] 

Was it not agreed/ implemented, that the customer number should be transferred in fullfilment started status?
h2. Desired Situation:

That's why a change is needed that the customer number is transferred to OGW in the *fulfilment started status* message from VKD.;;;","01/Feb/24 5:19 PM;elango.durairaj@vodafone.com;[~nina.pickl@vodafone.com]  785791 ACC1 , test2b,  order was successfully completed in unity backend without any issue.

My assumption right now is, that the ""lost"" updates before where due to the environment issues on VFW side and we actually only have the issue of updates that are send by another VKD system that are not supposed to be sent for VFW orders.;;;","27/Mar/24 4:08 PM;ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com;[~simon.auch@vodafone.com]  I am not really sure if I understand your comment correctly.

So you mean that we have to retry it once again because backend might had some problems?

The ""lost"" updates most likely were due to the environment issues on VFW side, or at least we cannot reproduce them anymore since they have been fixed.
The problematic updates sent to OSF by other cable systems that are missing the customer ID, should not happen anymore.

For some reason the unity system did not create an ""order"" (compared to the ""pending order"") in this case. This however seems to be a general problem on the UAT06 right now. I asked Mirko Saviano for some input regarding this.

;;;","31/May/24 7:16 PM;simon.auch@vodafone.com;According to Mirko Saviano:
""As I learned now, that someone currently stopped the approval job in Cablemaster. Perhaps that is the reason""
In addition it was turned off by asmitha.gayam@vodafone.com if needed it must be discussed with here to have it turned back on (or to figure out how long it stays disabled). Please get in contact with her to find out when the approval job is enabled again.
