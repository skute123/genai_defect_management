So ACC1 we have additionally to the unitymedia linking issue an issue with Mobile & VKD linking as described in the ticket.

But it the same is not reproducible on ACC2, it might not be caused by OGW delivery CN_17917 as all the production fixes in there are already merged to ACC2 end of last week with CN_17930

|orderExistingCustomer|VkdGatewayService/v2/customers/\{customerId}/products|existing customer|

I want to point out that the customer id is not present in the order (nor in any other order from that day).
I strongly believe that this is not a cable issue.
I double checked the response from the hal browser and there the customer id is returned to OSF.

Since I was also contacted through teams: I think the next step should be that OSF check the explicit request they send to us (the json request, not some intermediate xml) together with the endpoint they send it to.
Without these two things I will not be able to help further.;;;","15/Sep/23 7:57 PM;rohan.kumbhar@vodafone.com;OGW to check the issue --

Hi Gokul,

As i told you in the last week triage call, still we didn't pick the ticket to debug as it is P3

But now got confirmation from Neha that it is working fine 

then RCA might be it started working in the latest build number, previous build it might be impacted by fixing any other issue relevant to that area seems.

The target 20090213 is defined as DEFAULT, not DEFAULT OBLIGATED.
But even though, the product 20090213 cannot be deselected.
The software team must fix this issue, so the target product 20090213 is going to be put into shopping cart as default, but could be deselected anytime by agent if necessary.

Step on OSF GUI 
============
1. search customer, any string
2. click on ""Paket Ändern"" change package
3. select a DTAG tarif
4. select any hardware which is not Fritzbox 5590

You would get below window, and the product 20090213 is not deselectable:

if you check the attached files, the zip file with the biggest filesize is the pcat-config data. You could import it use your tool plm.php.
I even send you the test stub FN_ILS_FTTH_DTAG.zip for that, so you could reproduce the error in your environemnt.
The Log file would also show you how it was running in our environement.
The number of TTWOS ticket is attached on the ticket, so you could find all the info about the customer there.
Why you need the prod data, if I already send you the test stubs used the anonymized data.

[~shuyan.luo@vodafone.com]  I did import PCAT which you have provided in my local environment and the hardware not showing, and trying PCAT imports every time take more time that is why I asked for PCAT dump.

Hi [~shuyan.luo@vodafone.com]  ,

Based on the code investigation, it appears that this is not a issue, the manual_override_allowed field value is 0 in the catalog_package_subtypes table which is why its not allowing to deselect the hardware.

When the PCAT files are imported, the values of this field are set according to the values available in the PCAT files, so if the PCAT file does not contain this filed value for any stack, the value is considered to be 0.

When the manual_override_allowed field is set to 1 for a fixed stack, then the hardware can be deselected in the configurator according to the value in the manual_override_allowed field.

We identified the root cause of this issue and suggested to have mutual override allow enabled for sub package having these hardwares. but this was causing some other issues which i discussed with Marco and Shuyan.

I am trying with existing expression to fix this issue if not then next step would be to have a new expression which will override the logix written for mutual exclusive categories.

The functionality working as designed. the code  is intentionally written to remove the deselected product form the cart and  remove all of its associated defaulted products from the cart.

We talked about one option with ""manual_override_allowed "", which should meke the ""De-select"" possible. BUT, since ""manual_override_allowed "" is going to delete too much, and a change on this would cause design change due to Hari analyse below, so this option is not an option anymore.

Hi 
 
[~simran.mogram1@vodafone.com] 
 
Bascically, in terms of CR712. we haven’t change in payload (Request/Resposne) structure for any NBA interfaces (getNBA,CaptureResponse, ProcessFeedback)

so Pega interaction with old endpoints or new endpoint must have same payload (Request/Resposne) structure.

Recommend to check in current Pega PROD logs to see is there any ContainerID sent in Pega (getNBA)

For me this looks a new request. and must handle as an improvement.

If  disagree; ask to setup a short call.;;;","05/Sep/23 8:35 PM;gokul.vade@vodafone.com;As discussed with PEGA Team, Container ID value can be added by PEGA side and not required from the Request (OMnius).

The issue isn't valid issue because we tested on local (acc1 code) with the stub, which worked on SB1, and it is working fine, if it’s a software issue in that case it should not work in the local environment with the stubbed customer.
This probably is PCAT ruling issue so please check with PCAT team.

We analyzed the debug logs from the ACC environment and concluded, that our developed PCAT rules are executing correctly. Especially because the rules work as expected on our sandboxes, we cannot explain the different behavior with the same software version on ACC and PROD.

That why we assume an environment problem or a software bug.

When we are checking the logs, we can find that CRFN314 is evaluating to true.

If this rule is evaluating to true, then product must be added to cart.

 

You can find the debug log files, we used, attached to this ticket. We don´t have access to log files from PROD environment.

[~natasa.dimovic1@vodafone.com]  The issue isn't valid issue because we tested on local with the stub, which worked on SB1, and it is working fine, if it’s a software issue in that case it should not work in the local environment with the stubbed customer.

This probably is PCAT ruling issue so please check with PCAT team.

Please see the attached SS.

It is many time said, that with the same version OSE and PCAT, different behavior are given on different test servers.
So the reason could be:
- the (standard-)libs which OSE software included, are not in the same version on different server
- the webserver, or the workframes on which OSE are running do not have the same version or same configuration on different test servers ...

There could be many reasons, which could be investigated by software developers or admins for test servers, BUT NEVER somebody, who are delivering reference datas (product catalogues) :-D

So I would assign the ticket back to developer team, they should write down the instructruction or installation guide for the deployment team, so that the admins for test servers could check, which system configuration maybe wrong due the installation/instruction guide.

[~natasa.dimovic1@vodafone.com]  We have checked two PCATS with the same code base one is from sb1 environment which is working as expected and another one from the acc1 that is probably published from the dtl4 which is not working properly.

As per our initial investigation it looks like the product C_comfort is removed because it has been considered mutually exclusive product which is why it is removing from the cart.

Hello all,

we checked the specification and we have to adapt the delivered specification:

The response is NOT enclosed with box brackets [].

So, the following response structure is correct:

{ ""access_token"": ""e3YxfWMyOGRjMTY5NGU1MzYwZDhjNTE2NGQ4ZTg4MzhkMzk3ZTg5NDA4MWY3NTBlMjQwOWMxOGJlZDU1ZWMwM2EzNDA="", ""token_type"": ""Bearer"", ""expires_in"": 86400 }

We will update the specification accordingly and will send it to you.


Kind regards,
Christian

in var/log folder or path.;;;","23/Aug/23 8:43 PM;ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com;As per analysis from Horst:
Admin panel says reindexing required. I also had take a look into our PCAT sandbox pcat-int and SB2/SIT1 which should be comparable to ACC2.

I can see that there are different version on all environments with different results on Admi panel in indexing management.
there seems to be a problem with the version because all versions higher than 9.17.0-B16 show problem in Admin panel

We have triggered 1 Unity Media order(Region 9) from OSF Portal where as per our observation the status shown on the Cable Frontend(test1b) is not getting updated due to some issue between Cable/UM.
Flow:-
1.	Order triggered successfully from OSF ACC1 Telesales Portal
2.	Order submitted successfully from OGWCable—u can refer the order id reaching Test1b in the below highlighted SS(OGWOid-1664654)
3.	Weborder id successfully created—7711702

Issue: Somehow we are seeing that the SetOrderStatus from Cable(In ProgressFullfillmentStarted with CableOID) is not received in OGW—might be Cable is waiting for Unity Media to update on its further processing.

So can you please help here to check this issue on priority—as issue seems to be that there is some problem with CableUnityMedia via Minerwa Gateway or might be problem between Cable backendFrontend( 3.TestTest1B)

NOTE: We also tried to trigger using Region 2 –but exactly getting same issue

 

;;;","11/Aug/23 5:18 PM;rohan.kumbhar@vodafone.com;as per Cable team:
Region 09 and 02 couldn’t be UM region. These are VKD footprint regions.
But the failure with SetOrderStatus could have same root cause that we had last days on test2b environment.
It’s actually fixed for both environment, but could be that deployment isn’t done for test1b or was failed.
I already asked to restart/redeploy. But it could take time (maybe will done first on monday) because Portals Developers have TechDay today and out of office.

While gathering the information from the call I noticed that the requests were being sent to different Minerva instances, we can see this from the logs they appear in.

The successful order 7717071, was made using the minervaRD instance. This is pointing to RNSUAT08, UAT05 and the August libraries
The unsuccessful order 7717076, was made using the minervaUAT instance. This is pointing to RNSUAT09, UAT09 and the September libraries

I have attached the libraries lists for info of this.

The order that was successful, contains from OSF a transaction reference that begins “7717071” and this number is also sent in the <orderID> field of the request.
For the failure, the expected reference is 7717076, but the only order received for that customer (NRW 218944001) has a transaction reference and <orderID> of 5909756


Thanks Alison for the below explanation !!

@Anton Ustimenko, Vodafone: Please can you check from VKD end for the failed order—as it seems Cable is sending wrong  order id to Unity media for the associated Customer

Correct order  id Cable shall send in Request to Minerva for Customer id: 218944001   OID: 7717076
Issue: Cable sending wrong Order id for Customer id: 218944001    5909756( not sure why and from  where its been sent)

there is a problem on MAMAS side. MAMAS developers are working on the solution right now. Unfortunately, this is not clear when it will be fixed.
Therefore, we decided to switch test1b to another MAMAS backend for AvailabilityCheck (mamas-test3 -> mamas-test2).
This should unblock the tests.

Spider error got resolved. Below is the RCA provided by UM team. I will check on the new error highlighted.

RCA from spider team:

We removed a useless and (as we thought) unused function from a package in scope of bug fix ITCOBSPI-1084. Unluckily it wasn’t completely unused, that’s why one of the packages used by SpiderWS’es getAdditionalBuildingInfo threw an error. Now we removed the useless call of this function.
Due to your complaints we will avoid this situation on Go Live of ITCOBSPI-1084

The audio file was successfully imported (finally after fixing the recordings folder), but not enriched and therefore not send to OSF.

I found the issue in the databases: 

there is a mismatch between REC_DATE_TIME='2023-07-18_12-37-30' and 'rec_date=2023-07-18_12-42-47'

REC_DATE_TIME is extracted from audio filename {*}01c0035a05ef7142{*}_01J33O5I5GAAD9GFSI9T02LAES0000IB_2023-07-18_12-37-30-0391024B-1001534D-00000001.wav

The rec_date is from IRF_USER_DATA_CUST_3.RECORDINGATTRIBUTES (respectively the WDE extension)

For the enrichment process both datetime strings must be the same! 

 

-> further analysis ongoing;;;","03/Aug/23 12:20 PM;dirk.kaemmerling@vodafone.com;Issue was fixed at IPCC on Tuesday 01.08. Voicefiles was successfully proceed to OGW as well. Team was informed to the same. No further q. or updates, so I guess we are fine and the ticket can be closed

*This defect is to report one specific error related to the usage of adress data in checkout section during Move*

1) in case of Move from VKD to unity, the customer address stays on the old location and is not change automatically to new location
2) The billing address can only be given as customer address or different address. When customer address is the old address, the invoice would be also on the old address or we have to select different billing address


*New defect will be raised for this:*
a) If we change the customer address to new location, we are not able to select any other delivery option then pickup location which is wrong

As discussed with Srujana(Devi Jampana) me and Prabir

Is any user story existing regarding this address change related, then only we can fix this issue

So Devi will check with Ari and Thomas and update here.

If requirement is thre then she needs to provide Customer data Mode1 , Mode2 and mode3 OGW response logs

and System test result document either from ACC1 or ACC2 Env along with Testing steps to reproduce this issue.

 ;;;","05/Sep/23 1:07 PM;ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com;[~devi.jampana@vodafone.com]  please raise one new defect:

-> in case we are changing the customer adress within Move flow, we only see pickup location as delivery option and order fails with Sky ticket 
-> from my end this is a software defect



For the request, that customer adress has *automatically* to be changed during Move I will write to Christiane, Nora and Thomas and we use this defect OS-41106 for the tracking ;;;","11/Sep/23 12:54 PM;dadasaheb.narbat@vodafone.com;HI [~devi.jampana@vodafone.com]  Please share latest update.;;;","11/Sep/23 5:23 PM;devi.jampana@vodafone.com;Closing the defect as per the below comment from Thomas

For Move offnet it is OK that the address is not changed automatically. It should be possible to manually change it, that is what we agreed with the Agents.

Raised a defect related to delivery options of Move from VKD to UM

i continued with the further steps but issue is not reproducible

we can able to see the BEW section in check out page

So is this the PCAT issue or code issue , pleas check and confirm us once.

 ;;;","26/Jul/23 5:07 PM;simon.auch@vodafone.com;I am not aware of any marker products with which cable product logic can influence the OSF checkout behaviour regarding the voice logs.

I am also not aware of any VkdGateway or cable rules plugin interface that should be used to control the OSF checkout behaviour regarding voice logs.

In the timeframe given by the bug overview there also shouldn't have been any deployments of cable services or logic regarding OSF ACC.

As it stands cable will not be able to help with this ticket. If you find out why the voice log is missing from the checkout and the cause still points to cable logic, I will be happy to help.

Hi All,
Thank you all for joining the call!!

 

Please find the final Action points/summary below from our call today:

 

1) As discussed on call RCA still not yet found.
2) Discussed with dyna-web-de@netrom.ro,Catalin.Bradescu@Dynacommerce.com,Catalin.Balaci@Dynacommerce.com

    We meant memory related space, for the database data or for the application storage.  

3) If issue happened Immediately we have to check with TechM

4) Alexandra need to be contacted  incase of any PCAT issue in ACC. 

5) If any log required they can reach to ACC team.

 

 

Please feel free to add/update any points which we discussed in our call and is not covered in above MOM.;;;","27/Jul/23 12:09 PM;bharath.krishnamurthy@vodafone.com;Alexandra Vaduva added a comment -
 
Regarding point 4, if the problem is related to the code (Omnius part) then yes, we can take a look, but it is not clear why PCAT issues should go through dev team . We are not the ones who build PCATs and those type of issues should be assigned to PCAT team.;;;","27/Jul/23 3:52 PM;ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com;[~bharath.krishnamurthy@vodafone.com]  there was no issue in PCAT.

We had exactly the same version from 19th to 20th of July (all was good) and from 20th to 21st of July (DSL/FTTH Hardware broken).

The only change on that day was the deployment of TechM delivery CN_17751, after that data got lost over night for several days.

It started working after cable imported an updated catalogue, which does not have to do with fixnet hardware. It seems the system / process needed a push for overnight import to correct the data again. As it was working with the cable version before until 20th of July !

So again, there was no PCAT change which could have caused the problem.

 

However, seems we are not able to find out so we will close the defect for now ;;;","27/Jul/23 4:28 PM;bharath.krishnamurthy@vodafone.com;[~ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com]

As we have checked this address, the functionality works as expected, therefore this is not an OSE issue.

For the following address, we are not receiving anything from the checkout products rulings which is why the section is not visible.

Von-Galen-Str. 7 51063 Köln Mülheim

Thanks,

could you rerun the test after enabling the logging as described here: [How to get acc logs - Portals - Vodafone DE Confluence|https://de.confluence.agile.vodafone.com/display/PORTALS/How+to+get+acc+logs]

Once we have these logs we should be able to determine whether or not it is in fact a cable issue and if it is also find out the root cause.;;;","29/Aug/23 1:17 PM;devi.jampana@vodafone.com;Hi [~simon.auch@vodafone.com]

as we already track this issue on ACC2/Wave8.1 under OS-42066 and it will not be possible to solve it with W8.0, would you please cancel this Bug on ACC1?

After confirmation by Ari, it would be fine to track it only on ACC2.

1) Simran Mogram, Vodafone Explained issue.
2) Checked I-09 log form oil side, Time stamp checked for requst /Responce. Looks fine
3) Checked in omniusaa_int_db any entry stuck or not in db. But looks fine 
4) Processfeedback endpoint missmatch , Configuration corrected 
5) After flushing cache Token not generated 
6) then restarted Server,Then submitted flow But facing same issue 
7) Suspect Processfeedback file not created

 

*Action Point* 

Bhavesh RenparaPramodkumar Chauhan, Vodafone checking this issue 

 

Aside from Bhavesh

In my analyses so far i can say it's something related to config issue, or related to token based process feedback interface. After ContractGenerate with OM, while sending processfeedback to PEAG we have issue. If it's tokens based processfeedback interface then this issue should be there before as well but somehow not identified so far in ACC. In prod token based interface is not live so no worry. Also verified release content and we don't have any change which can be responsible for this issue.

ResourceNotFoundException: Could not find customer with crm VKD and id 149617803

can you please ask them what is this error?;;;","11/Jul/23 12:52 PM;vandana.rajanna@vodafone.com;[~devi.jampana@vodafone.com] - Please check and respond;;;","13/Jul/23 3:44 PM;ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com;[~ran.farjun1@vodafone.com]  I think we have to look at the flow in total to understand the problem.

* We have a unitymedia customer and a mobile customer 

* We try to link both customers

{color:#de350b}** At this moment the customer seems to be changed by the system to a VKD customer* {color}

{color:#de350b}{color:#172b4d}-> and because of this there is afterwards the error message, that the customer cannot be found in VKD backend, but it should not search in VKD backend. The issue is before.{color}{color}

{color:#de350b}{color:#172b4d}Somehow the system seems to remove the prefix from unitymedia e.g UB or UN and replaces it with KD prefix.{color}{color}

{color:#de350b}{color:#172b4d}What do you need from us to further investigate that the system turns the Unity customer number to a KD customer number? {color}{color}

 ;;;","16/Jul/23 12:47 PM;ran.farjun1@vodafone.com;Hi [~ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com] 

as far as i know UM and VKD customers are handling the same way in OGW when using GetCustomerDetails service.
they both going to VKD backend;;;","18/Jul/23 1:05 PM;ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com;Hi [~ran.farjun1@vodafone.com] 

Both - VKD and Unity customers are communicating with backend via VKD gateway thats correct.

But of Course OSF should not add prefix KD to a unity customer which always has prefix UN, UB or UH

The problem is not the call to the backend!

The problem is, that OSF is swapping the customer prefix from UN to KD / UB to KD / UH to KD ;;;","18/Jul/23 5:59 PM;ran.farjun1@vodafone.com;OSF is not adding VKD to unity media customer. if it was like that we would have a lot of defects regarding this issue before this one.

The case here is unique, in the request we are getting global id as :LK_....

and usually we will take the prefix from the global id: like UN, UB or UH.

so now we didnt found a match in cable prefix to LK, so we sent to VKD backend only the id without the prefix.

so i fix it now and we will send to VKD the id and the correct prefix.;;;","19/Jul/23 10:05 AM;dadasaheb.narbat@vodafone.com;Hi [~ran.farjun1@vodafone.com]  could you please assign it to report. ;;;","21/Jul/23 4:09 PM;dadasaheb.narbat@vodafone.com;As per mail, It will Deliver on date 26 Jul.;;;","26/Jul/23 4:54 PM;deepak.garg1@vodafone.com;Fixed in CN_17766;;;","28/Jul/23 12:16 PM;devi.jampana@vodafone.com;Test In Progress

Hi Devi ,

This issue doesn’t look like omnius issue, we are getting exception in response of MODE1 response from OGW.

requests, and responses;;;","15/Aug/23 1:47 PM;ran.farjun1@vodafone.com;Hi Devi,
i check the DB, for LK_16675, there is 2 customers:
KD_346741202, KS_117245594.

when trying to call VKD we are sending CRM = VKD inside the URL
and VKD backend will no know that this is UM customer.

when create linkid check if the request was send with the correct data.
meaning: 

<SourceGlobalIDList>
<GlobalID>UB_/UN_/UH_</GlobalID>
</SourceGlobalIDList>
and not 

<SourceGlobalIDList>
<GlobalID>KD_17732321</GlobalID>
</SourceGlobalIDList>

when i trigger the flow with UB prefix i got this in the DB:
""LINK_ID"":""LK_16724"",
    ""TARGET_SYSTEM"":""UM"",
    ""ENTITY_ID"":""UB_177323321"",
so when i try to trigger getCustomer Details, the request was sent with 

crm=UME-KBW;;;","16/Aug/23 1:46 PM;ran.farjun1@vodafone.com;after call with Devi we found the issue:
the request that didnt work sent 2 ids, 1 of the ids was already link.

also in the request, TargetGlobalID was empty. in that case we are checking if customer already link,

we retrieve the linkid from the DB and compare it to the TargetGlobalID  from the request. if its not a match the new id will not be link to it. and that was the case for this defect. and this is expected behavior. ;;;","16/Aug/23 1:57 PM;devi.jampana@vodafone.com;Hi All,

But potential link option is not available 

Instead after sometime link got created in the backend

!image-2023-10-10-08-36-37-349.png|width=489,height=80!

 

2)Placed 2 different orders , one with mobile and other with Unity by giving the same details like first name,lastname,date of birth, mail id, iban number etc

OSF ID:1004693    OGW ID:2714872     CN:1003055803

OSF ID:1004751     Mobile:KS_117588009

Potential link option is not available and also link was not created in the backend

 

3)Took an existing UM Customer and added mobile to it

OSF ID:1004797      Unity CN:409058502   Mobile:KS_117588026

Potential Link option is avaiilable and link was created as expected

Linkid:

LK_15420

!image-2023-10-10-08-41-24-702.png|width=409,height=218!

So only the Third scenario is working fine

 

Kindly look into this

immediately after potential link(OS-40061) we are doing get customer details service, in this service we encounter an error, so i suggested to open different ticket (OS-47382) for this issue.;;;","16/Nov/23 3:46 PM;saiswarup.singhdeo@vodafone.com;Testing team will retest after deployment.;;;","17/Nov/23 12:01 PM;devi.jampana@vodafone.com;Hi [~ran.farjun1@vodafone.com] 

We tried all 3 scenarios in ACC2

First Scenario:

Placed an order with Mobile and Unity order together in a single order:

OSF ID:1018903    Unity Customer:{*}1010584401{*} Mobile{*}:KS_117251370{*}  OGW ID:2738810

Potential link is shown and after clicking on link we got the same error:

!image-2023-11-17-11-50-51-948.png|width=243,height=139!

Link is created in the backend: Link ID: *lk_15817*

 

Second Scenario:

Placed Mobile order separately and Unity order Separately

Mobile OSF ID:1018907 Mobile customer:{*}KS_117251372{*} 

Unity OSF ID:1018781 Unity  CustomerNumber:{*}UN_1010557201{*}  OGW id:2738554   

Potential link is available and after linking getting the same error as above

Link got created in the backend:Link:{*}LK_15816{*}

 

Third Scenario:

Took an existing Unity customer and added mobile to it

*Unity:1010555101*    OSF ID:1018909     OGW ID:2738818

*Mobile:117251373*

Link got created on its own without showing the potential link option:{*}LK_15819{*}

 

We checked the Retrieve customer info logs and we can see the same error(11 digits error) as we discussed in the call

Attaching one OGW response logs[^LK_15816 OGW Response.xml]

 

^Hi [~ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com]^ 

^Can we get a confirmation whether the deployment for this defect was done ?^

 

Regards

Srujana

 ;;;","17/Nov/23 3:58 PM;devi.jampana@vodafone.com;HI [~ran.farjun1@vodafone.com] 

As discussed in previous call, we raised defect for the customer cannot be loaded issue https://jira.sp.vodafone.com/browse/OS-47382

At that time we faced the issue with only 1 scenario, but now we can see the same issue in 2nd scenario as well

But potential link option is available and link is created in backend for all the 3 scenarios and we are able to search the link in OSF and customer details are shown correctly

So this OS-40061 fix is just to create the link for the orders but not for the error that is shown in the  front end?

And if it is correct then the front end issue will be delivered in https://jira.sp.vodafone.com/browse/OS-47382?

 

Regards

Srujana;;;","19/Nov/23 1:14 PM;ran.farjun1@vodafone.com;Hi Devi,

correct.
OS-40061: this is just getting results from potential link service. its not creating the link, just search for customer with the same details that was sent by Omnius and getting results.
if its work you will see the option to link 2 customers



OS-47368: this defect regarding a service  after linking the customer. Omnius triggering getCustomerDetails service, Omnius is sending the global id as LINK_ID
the issue is that OGW is not handling it correctly for UM customer when global id is link id.

fix for OS-40061 is currently on ACC2

OS-47368, fix is not on ACC2;;;","20/Nov/23 6:54 AM;devi.jampana@vodafone.com;Thanks for the clarification [~ran.farjun1@vodafone.com] 

As potential link option is working fine, We can close this issue

Front end issue will be checked in OS-47368

Could you change the status of the defect , so that i can close it

If it is the permission, How can it be that I can find some offers in Retail AND in Telesales?

Hello Natasa,

We will retest it once again in retail channel;;;","18/Jul/23 1:39 PM;lukas.haes@vodafone.com;Hi,
searching for an CS-ID is possible without any (new) permission. Its analog to search for customer ID.;;;","18/Jul/23 1:44 PM;satish.dhere1@vodafone.com;[~vikash.saurav@vodafone.com] 

Hello Vikas,

We have checked in telesales channel(without any permission) advance search with CS id worked successfully but in retail channel(without any permission), advance search with CS id is failing.

This does not seem to be any issue, it just seems that there is a problem with the data we checked for this CSID's '8285973,8285958'

In the offer_status_visibility_editability table, there is no entry for the combination offerStatus ='CS_Pending' and channel = 'Retail', which is why records for the customer search are not searched.

and during the test of Deletion of pending offers it worked also in Retail. Could you please check that again? Thanks;;;","09/Aug/23 7:24 PM;lukas.haes@vodafone.com;Hi [~vikash.saurav@vodafone.com],
so if it should only work for telesales, why is the CS-ID field also implemented in Retail UI? This does not make any sense to implement a textfield without any functionality behind this.

As described in OS-19763 it should also be possible in retail channel. This story was created and designed by [~shruti.kanchan@vodafone.com] 

Also [~natasa.dimovic1@vodafone.com] mentioned that it was already working fine as described in story on ACC during test in 7.2

Hi All,


ASB Value if it comes in serviceability I believe Omnius submits but that was part of Cable or DSL
 
We have not hardcoded or designed anything from our side on FTTH
 
ASB is Anschlussbereiches (Connection Area) details. One Area code can have multiple connection areas. This value is received in ServiceAvailabilityResponse (LineItem/Asb)
 
[https://st9-oil-vfde.dynacommercelab.com/Archive/WCFProxy/I08_CheckServiceAbility/2023/7/7/10[…]GWResponse__355eeb25-22c7-4a8c-8918-9d7c13ee897c.xml|https://st9-oil-vfde.dynacommercelab.com/Archive/WCFProxy/I08_CheckServiceAbility/2023/7/7/103739_0h0chvk879sfs7233dhnpkerad/103740_0h0chvk879sfs7233dhnpkerad_OGWResponse__355eeb25-22c7-4a8c-8918-9d7c13ee897c.xml]
 
ASB value was not part of the design.
 
ASB was not a requirement even for GPON which was a FTTH product 2 years ago, this was not part of FTTH design since the beginning.

That message was initially initially received at the HTTP endpoint of SBUS at 14:18:37,890:

Why exactly the sending of the message took 5s to be seen again in the VFP endpoint, I don’t know. Maybe the network is slow ?

This message reached SBUS at 14:18:42,385, the request was routed to VFP at 14:18:42,401 (16 ms).
Only 4ms later (14:18:42,405) SBUS acknowledges the request.
The VFP information has been calculated at 14:18:52,320, at least that’s when SBUS is sending the response, which is done 4 ms later (14:18:52,329).
About 60 ms later SBUS acknowledges, that the response has been received (14:18:52,388). This response is then routed to the requester.
That is done between 14:18:52,392 and 14:18:52,402 (14 ms).

So all in all SBUS the time between the request reached SBUS and the time the final response was sent, is about 10s and about 99% of the time was
used to calculate the VFP data.

So overall analysis states that this issue is unavoidable as the system will respond on its time depending upon the services request sent from FE towards backend.

we need to close this defect–as we already investigated with SBUS/VFP dev team and as per them the response to the systems depends upon the services available on the specific address.

So as per them the system configuration and performance it is working fine as of now - but this performance can be increased once we have moved VFP to cloud.

 ;;;","17/Jul/23 5:57 PM;ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com;[~rohan.kumbhar@vodafone.com]  it worked fine until some weeks. So its not clear why we started to become this slow performance.

If we want to monitor then can we please have this retried and confirm if this is still occurring.

As from OGW,SBUS,VFP dev/infra–it was nothing wrong nor any issue at their end nor they found anything to get this fixed;;;","24/Jul/23 4:37 PM;ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com;[~rohan.kumbhar@vodafone.com]  one day before this slow performance started we configured multiplexer on PR - this could not have caused the slowness, right?;;;","24/Jul/23 5:03 PM;rohan.kumbhar@vodafone.com;[~ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com] : It can be due to Multiplexer -may be when we connect to 3 Envs parallel. - So I request you to please check once again on ACC1 env --as here then we have different envs on both ACC and test the performance .

So as of now we can close the defect and open new one if we observe this issue again;;;","24/Jul/23 5:28 PM;ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com;I am not sure how to make it clear.

We have the issue all the time PERMANENTLY since around mid of June.

So no need to close this and open new one, as the issue was not solved. I could immediately open a new one.

It is still SLOW. 

Do we need to remove the configuration of ACC3 to check if this had side effects? ;;;","25/Jul/23 2:15 PM;rohan.kumbhar@vodafone.com;Hi Ari-- we can keep this defect if we want to track it–no need to remove ACC3 connection–may be lets keep this onhold and check on ACC2 env once we have all the BSS41 version connected-- so that ACC1/3 would be on same backend and ACC2 would be on different -so there we can check the performance. 

So I suggest to test this issue by End of Aug'23 where we will have different backend connections;;;","18/Aug/23 3:53 PM;saiswarup.singhdeo@vodafone.com;On HOLD till 28/08/2023;;;","01/Sep/23 1:38 PM;najnin.mulla1@vodafone.com;[~ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com] [~rohan.kumbhar@vodafone.com] [~gokul.vade@vodafone.com]

Ari

So for Natasas user this one is locked because reaching the threshold for customer search. So far this seems to be correct technical functionality (She is not locked when doing other things with this user)

1) Taher to create a user for Timo so he is able to trigger some requests

2) Ashish to explain what exactly happens to his TYQ-RT user

3) Natasa to check who is triggering with her user so many customer searches / or if calls are triggered too often 

4) Matthias to propose if we should move OGW deployment to PROD by one week

5) Sebastian to check for next alignment call;;;","21/Jun/23 8:24 PM;ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com;Current findings:
- Natasas User is locked because it reached the threshold of 80 service calls for customer search
- Ashish User is locked because it reched the threshold of the service calls for get payer information

So from technical perspective this seems to be ok

Currently under clarification:
1) Who is triggering the calls so often with these users, also at night? -> Timo to check if something can be identified for automation
2) Some calls seem to create multiple logs, so the count is higher than expected -> not yet discussed, probably we need TechM for this;;;","27/Jun/23 12:35 PM;sneha.wayal1@vodafone.com;We have created new users and checked, Now it's working fine, Hence closing this ticket.;;;","30/Jun/23 2:06 PM;pallavi.kokate1@vodafone.com;Automation user getting locked again

Hereby the solution I applied yesterday on the SIT servers when I got requested to increase the SSH/SCP timeout for PCAT related functions.

 

In the /etc/sshd_config I made the ClientAliveInterval 3600. That would lead to a 3 x 3600 seconds timeout which worked fine for test, just to be on the big side for testing.

We can tune this a bit further for security and safety. For example this below approach could be taken. It does 60 times a check every 60seconds which totals to 1 hour which should be fine.

 

ClientAliveCountMax 60
ClientAliveInterval 60

 

Don’t forget to apply by running systemctl restart sshd

 

Kind Regards,

There are two entries for this role, one entry is in uppercase, and another entry is in CamelCase.
So, during CR-525 testing due to this discrepancy the above users are not getting locked.
Because for each service performed by above agent, omnius is sending one of the two entries to OGW and due to that user is not getting locked after crossing the threshold.

 

Steps to reproduce:
 # Login to Omnius BackOffice
 # search ""Retail Store Manager PA"" and ""Retail Store Manager FI""

Also we need to check wether its this issue here; [OTF-1022] Migration VF DSL to KIP UM - Vodafone Global Jira

Then it should not happen for 100% of the cases but only for few ;;;","15/Jun/23 11:51 AM;devi.jampana@vodafone.com;Hi All,

An update on the issue:
We have tried DSL Migration to UM with port again by giving the same customer address and service address
it worked fine and order reached backend
But when we tried DSL Migration to UM Without port by giving same customer address and service address
we got the same sky ticket and failed with same error
""Required Input CARRIERIDENTIFICATION_AREA_CODE/CARRIERIDENTIFICATION_PHONE_NUMBER in Porting Information missing.""

Srujana;;;","15/Jun/23 1:11 PM;ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com;Thanks [~devi.jampana@vodafone.com]  for checking it :)

So for DSL with porting the issue was caused by data (Maybe we have to analyse this in a different way later)
This defect is then remaining for DSL migration without porting only ;;;","15/Jun/23 3:40 PM;devi.jampana@vodafone.com;As discussed in the call,

We should recheck both scenarios, In case order is not failing and processed correctly in backend I think its not a problem to have the phone number even if not needed.

The reason why you are seeing different results here is because of the different environment configurations .

According to the following ticket : [!https://dynalean.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/universal_avatar/view/type/issuetype/avatar/10303?size=medium!VFDEUMI-630: St11 | Cable option is shown in move offnet text box when Move Offnet (Move Service) for VKD is set to NODONE|https://dynalean.atlassian.net/browse/VFDEUMI-630] , the following configurations affect these results : BO → System → Configuration → Sales → Sales → Unity Media :

!8bc007af-7cbf-4f67-b6eb-9419d24b8f68.png!

 

If “Move Service for VKD” is set to “Yes” , then we are able to see the expected results :

Please find below our output regarding this ticket:

After investigating this issue, we have found that there is a default obligated rule which adds by default the product with SKU *UMCFUMZUGOP* to the array of selected products no matter of which product is selected from the
configurator. Further, when the artefact is evaluating and running the rules, it seems that it fails for exactly that specific product: {*}UMCFUMZUGOP{*}. See attached screenshot below:

!image-2023-07-04-18-46-05-326.png! After we deleted the obligated rule and made the flow again everything was working as expected because the problematic product is not added anymore and the artifact is not failing anymore.  !image-2023-07-04-18-46-35-567.png! The obligated rule is the following:  !image-2023-07-04-18-47-15-995.png!

So the problem would be related to that rule or to the artefact.
Please review our analysis. Since this is not a code related problem, we are not able to fix it, but you can get in touch with the person/team responsible for the PCAT/artefact. ;;;","04/Jul/23 6:51 PM;singireddy.reddy@vodafone.com;assigned to benjamin sasche;;;","04/Jul/23 6:52 PM;singireddy.reddy@vodafone.com;Hi [~benjamin.sachse@vodafone.com] 

Could you please look into it.

Regards,

Harsha;;;","06/Jul/23 9:13 PM;ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com;mentionted the issue in PCAT chatgroup to ask for support;;;","10/Jul/23 6:50 PM;ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com;[~fabian.keilbach@vodafone.com] will remove the mentioned rule overnight to check the impact on E2E flow, as we assume this rule / SKU *UMVFUMZUGOP* is important for unitymedia backend 

Probably we need to insert it then once again after retest tomorrow

[~devi.jampana@vodafone.com]  please plan one retest tomorrow and check how fast the order can be placed :);;;","11/Jul/23 9:21 AM;devi.jampana@vodafone.com;Hi [~ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com]
We tried placing the order in ACC1 now and we are still facing the same issue
After selecting the product , Again it is getting deselected
 !screenshot-1.png|thumbnail! 


;;;","11/Jul/23 11:56 AM;ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com;Thanks for checking already. Fabian mentioned right now that somehow the change did not make it in overnight PCAT import :( 

So we have to wait probably until tomorrow;;;","12/Jul/23 8:32 PM;ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com;In the last PCAT there was some change related to this problem but this did not help. We try it now with mentioned workaround for TechM. Waiting for confirmation from Fabian, when we should retest;;;","13/Jul/23 11:58 AM;ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com;Fabian did the mentioned changes from TechM - so I am going to check it today.
however, we do not think that its a good solution to remove this SKU *UMVFUMZUGOP*  because we are pretty sure it needs to be used. We will roll back the changes after retest, and most likely need to get in touch again with TechM ;;;","13/Jul/23 2:47 PM;ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com;I have checked it once, and I am able to select the products after we removed this SKU / Rule.

However, there are different observations within the flow, like:

1) CS not created for Move

2) logs seem to miss CS related information, thats probably why its not generated

3) UPC Code errors in backend 

So for this ticket I am not sure if we can leave the configuration. To not impact PCAT Cable Release Go Live we add the SKU again over night. For further tests we probably need to remove it again to be unblocked but maybe also we find a different solution;;;","18/Jul/23 9:17 PM;ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com;There was a test catalogue on ACC2, with a different solution, and also products are selectable.

INFO: PCAT on ACC2 was removed as we are now first of all deploying new 8.1 code to ACC2

after software is stable we can get in touch with Team Ash again to get the workaround once more to retest.

During the last meeting the global tracking feature on ACC3 was already disabled and the databases sizes were small.

The suggestion was to disable the Global Tracking on the remaining ACC environments as well and then repeat the DB shrink procedure again.

Another recommendation was to run the jobs as ‘sa’ user, instead of the current one configured.

Hi Silpa,

Marcin Jurczak 
added a comment -
 
Last week there were a few calls to check/reproduce this issue. We could see that with I22 service everything is fine. However, we were facing different intermittent issues, not related to OIL. For example, after submitting an order, OGW sends a failed status to I10. This may need checking on OGW side.;;;","12/Jul/23 1:53 PM;silpa.nanda2@vodafone.com;[~bharath.krishnamurthy@vodafone.com] 

Hi All,

This issue is occurring only for CS Confirmation (Submit Order), I22 Logs are getting more than 5 mins to generate logs and this is intermittent issue and needs to investigate from OIL side, Also I10 logs are not required to check because here issue is coming before submit order.;;;","12/Jul/23 6:36 PM;bharath.krishnamurthy@vodafone.com;[~silpa.nanda2@vodafone.com] 

Could you please  provide the exact time of sending the particular PushOfferStatus messages

from OGW side for further analysis from OIL side.;;;","12/Jul/23 7:21 PM;silpa.nanda2@vodafone.com;We have checked this issue. now it's working fine but as this is intermittent issue, So here we need to investigate why  sometimes it's not working, hence please check from your side and provide your input.;;;","17/Jul/23 2:01 PM;dadasaheb.narbat@vodafone.com;HI [~bharath.krishnamurthy@vcontractor.co.za]  Could you please share latest update.

If issue comes again, we need more precise analysis on what exactly is the issue.

currently the ticket suggests that OIL has some delay in processing PushOfferStatus requests, but in my opinion, it's OGW for which it takes long time to generate the messages

in my last update I asked for providing some evidence - message upload time from OGW, but instead of that we're just getting info that it's working fine.;;;","18/Jul/23 6:38 PM;silpa.nanda2@vodafone.com;Hi All,

We have checked this issue with all stacks new activation orders and few more combinations, Now we did not observed delay for generating I22 (PushOfferStatus) logs, Also order confirmation via CS link is working fine and Order is submitted successfully on front end.

 

Now this issue is not reproducible, seems this issue is solved after OIL server restart.

Hi Harsha / Srujana,

 
Alexandra Vaduva added a comment -
 
 
After analyzing the code which builds the contract information and the products / similar products required for reproduction, the following conclusions have been reached :

According to the initial implementation :

Can't find link , products _‘which dont have a charge are difficult to qualify if they are OTC or REC. If visibility is set to “not shown"" for Goody (package sub type) then these will be treated as REC charges.’_

On top of this implementation, this new fix

 

https://jira.sp.vodafone.com/browse/OS-14504

 

OSF | ACC1 | Wave 6.3 | TV Winback goodies not shown in Contract Summary in the monthly section

 

has been added which adds all the *cable stack* products in the REC (reouccurent payment)/OTC (one-time payment) section based on the _*'price_billing_frequency'*_ attribute . If the attribute is defined for the product as ONCE, then the product is added as a OTC commercial product. , it looks like that attribute is not defined for the product .;;;","14/Jul/23 7:55 PM;bharath.krishnamurthy@vodafone.com;[~singireddy.reddy@vodafone.com] [~devi.jampana@vodafone.com]

If I remember correctly the issue is related to products that are configured as what we call a ""checkout option"" (I am not sure there is an official term for this?).
Checkout options are options that are displayed in the checkout process of OSF in one of the dropdowns (like UMP5, UMP6, many technician options, etc).

If my assumption is correct the same problem should also appear for other checkout options that have a one time charge.
Someone with access to the backoffice of OSF can check the configured prices and rates of the affected products (UMP5, UMP6?) and compare them to other one time charge products (SHP for example).

Hi Akash,

 

Bhavesh Renpara

added a comment -

It’s very old implementation, even before wave 3 may be. It was implemented to have mechanism to avoid unnecessary call to VKF gateway for already validated address by our system.

In production this issue never occured as confirmed by M&S team as this feature was implemented to improve performance. ;;;","07/Jun/23 7:14 PM;akash.ubbu@vodafone.com;Hi [~bharath.krishnamurthy@vodafone.com] 

so if incase we are checking CR525 fraud detection part which is counting every trigger of any service from omnius and according to threshold its getting locked.

so how this functionality will be handled here if its avoiding unnecessary calls 

its confusing and it will be helpful if you can help with the above case;;;","08/Jun/23 7:48 AM;bharath.krishnamurthy@vodafone.com;[~akash.ubbu@vodafone.com] [~dadasaheb.narbat1@vodafone.com] [~saiswarup.singhdeo@vodafone.com]

Hi All,

I will reschedule meeting in next week, As we required Vodafone BA in this call.    

Hence we mark this defect status is *On-Hold* till we discuss about this issue further on next call.;;;","12/Jun/23 5:13 PM;nina.pickl@vodafone.com;After clarification with Thorsten Lehnert- the ValidateAddress logs for the *same address* should be generated after *each call* of the service.;;;","15/Jun/23 3:00 PM;kshitij.srivastava1@vodafone.com;Aligned with [~thorsten.lehnert@vodafone.com]  [~andreas.baldermann@vodafone.com] 

When agent perform serviceablity then ValidateAddress logs only being generated if there is E2E flow done. means service must triggers OSE<->OIL<->OGW<->VKD

Basically in past there is feature implemented to cache the ValidateAddress resposne with AddressId in OSE due to performance improvemnt 

so when Agent perfomer serviceablity sytem check the address combination in Cache and avoide the E2E call.

Cache always cleared end of bussiness hours.

So in my opinion this is not a defect.;;;","19/Jun/23 12:54 PM;nina.pickl@vodafone.com;Regarding Thorsten Lehnert we can close the Bug as WAD:

The issue was created by by database triggers, that exist in production only for maintenance reasons of the large database, were created under a wrong database user.

There was a full qualified table name in the trigger code which were redundant between two users. That led to the error because the triggers were created in the wrong schema.
As this is reoccurring process, to create/replace the triggers, the mistake has been corrected permanently in the code so that there is a good chance to not face this issue again.

are you sure this issue will not be fixed in POS-FE until go live end of june? I just want to make sure there is no effort on PCAT side to change rules if not needed.

Move Offnet Cable to DSL must stay possible!

DXC will not be able to fix this gap before Glasfaser Launch in 08/2023.;;;","20/Jun/23 3:21 PM;lukas.haes@vodafone.com;From Marcel:

Ich würde dann empfehlen +nichts+ in OSF zu machen. Wir lassen Move Offnet Kabel auf Glasfaser technisch weiter zu. Wir werden anfangs nur sehr sehr wenige Aufträge dazu haben.

Bis Oktober müssten diese dann durch OA manuell in POS-FE bearbeitet werden, bzw. bis Oktober geparkt werden. Ab Oktober sind wir dann hoffentlich sauber.

 

Könnt ihr dies bitte in folgendem Ticket vermerken und es entsprechend schließen?

The statement if was fast and now its slow does not help us to pinpoint the issue. This is not a quantified problem but based on a “feeling” of slowness.

The ticket does not provide any times that are expected or actual, nor does it show the network tab to see the response times of ajax calls.. The fact that this flow is not run in performance testing and we cannot see if the same is observed if we test the performance in a proper way.

!2023-07-24_172052.png!
Also we need proper steps to reproduce as the configuration of the package is not clear.

Nevertheless i performed the scenario in my local system and did not notice and significant slowdowns, see screenshot.

Something to point out is also that this flow is heavily dependent on the response time of services.

During the loading of the offer we are calling the following services:
 * RetrieveCustomerInfo mode1

 * RetrieveCustomerInfo mode2

 * RetrieveCustomerInfo mode3

 * ValidateAddress

 * CheckServiceAbility

 * GetHouseHoldMembers

 * GetVFDEConfigurationData (if not in cache)

If one of these services is slow to respond the loading of the offer will be delayed.

The lack of details in the ticket together with the fact that response times have a big influence on the overall performance in this flow should lead to the conclusion to reject this ticket.

LocationID is part of PDT functionality (Wave 4) when it was introduced in OSF and This scenario we are testing with FTTH product combination so this functionality (Tivano service request) should work, also we tested same scenario without FTTH product and getting same error so OGW should fix this issue.

Current Result: DELIVERY_LOCATION_ID value is going wrong in Tivano Input, OGW fetching data from DHLIdentificationNumber node (submit order request)

 This should happen with an valid german IBAN as well, but it is not clear why this was implemented like this and if there was a communication issue or not . If there was, we need clear specifications on how this should work exactly and the different cases so we can implement an appropriate fix.

Hi Harsha,
 
If the KUD product is not part of cable_app_de category then this check will not be shown and the agent is able to continue, otherwise this check will be shown and the agent will not be able to continue
 * In case of telesales, if sepa is true, then this check will be shown and the flow is blocked → agent is not able to continue

For further clarifications, you can check the original story :

https://jira.sp.vodafone.com/browse/OAF-179

OMNIUS : CHCK, As an agent i am allowed to proceed sales flow for cable package with mandatory residence check when SEPA is known, So that Agent can proceed next.;;;","26/Jul/23 10:53 AM;singireddy.reddy@vodafone.com;Will discuss with ari.;;;","15/Aug/23 8:40 PM;ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com;I still do not get it.

The story says: As an agent i am allowed to proceed sales flow for cable package with mandatory residence check when SEPA is known

-> In our example, SEPA Is known - but we are blocked and NOT able to proceed.
-> we are NOT using foreign IBAN

Something is wrong relate to the logic when we do not enter the IBAN itself but bank account and sort code !!
its only allowed for german bank data to use this option to enter bank account and sort code instead of IBAN

Hi Harsha/Ari,

This was clear from the beginning, yes, but as I mentioned, the implementation was intended to be like this :

*In case of telesales, if sepa is true, then this check will be shown and the flow is blocked → agent is not able to continue*

Which means that it does *NOT* matter _what IBAN is used_ , this will be shown if the sepa is true and *If the KUD product is part of cable_app_de category .* 

I agree that the way this is working is not consistent : in one case the agent is able to continue but in another the agent is not able to continue.

The final question is - when should the agent be able to continue the checkout process and when should the agent be blocked? According to the initial documentation the agent should not be able to continue and according to these comments the agent should be able to continue .

What is the purpose of this error message and what was wrongly implemented exactly? We can implement a fix according to these comments but we need to know if the issue is that the whole implementation was not done correctly or not, in order to fix the actual issue and not just a particular case .;;;","17/Aug/23 4:38 PM;ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com;The pop up says its not allowed to continue b{*}ecause of a foreign bank account or/ and different bank account holder{*}.

Hi Srujana ,

 

Firstly this is not error its feature. Check the below attached details which explains when and how the SEPA validation works. In the above case you can validate the same by getting *GetCablePayerAndPaymentInfo* details.

If you have any queries regarding this could you please schedule a call to conclude on expected behavior or please create new ticket for latest observation.;;;","08/Feb/24 1:37 PM;ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com;[~bharath.krishnamurthy@vodafone.com]  I am sorry but its not about a feature which should work in this way and we are running into circles all the time.

everything was properly explained and understood by Kshitik.

 

Please translate the error message into english! Its an error message that we are not allowed to go ahead because of foreign customer, or different bank account adress.

We are NOT using foreign adress or foreign IBAN here. We are also NOT using different bank account adress. 

We do not want to repeat the discussion again and again, please get in touch in Kshitij

 

You have to use the entry bank account number and sort code to enter it manually, then system is creating IBAN on its own automatically. 

If same IBAN would be typed in directly it works. Its about the functionality of using sort code and bank account number field;;;","12/Feb/24 3:47 PM;atharva.paskanthi@vodafone.com;Hello [~vikash.saurav@vodafone.com] , [~bharath.krishnamurthy@vodafone.com] , Can you please check the latest comment and provide update;;;","13/Feb/24 12:58 PM;atharva.paskanthi@vodafone.com;Comment from [~vikash.saurav@vodafone.com] :

MOM Of yesterdays call:

We had a discussion with Sunil, Bharath and Kshitij

We tried to place the orders in both the ways

i.e with Filling the IBAN directly and also by giving the account number and sort code details 

And we received the same error in both the ways and we checked the response in logs (ValidateIBAN and GetPayerandPaymentInfo ) and observed that customer details are not retrieved in the response as the IBAN provided are invalid IBANS

 

But We have also tried with the Correct German IBANS(Below are the IBANS Used) and still we received the same error (I.e IBAN is not german)

DE10600501010006622066

DE02120300000000202051

DE21200505500001183151,  DE69200505500001083153 (These 2 IBANS has always  worked with KUD Orders previously)

For these 4 IBANS we have checked the Logs (VlaidateIBAN and GetPayerandPaymentInfo ) and we recieved the correct response( i.e Customer details are visible on the Response and also SEPA is showing as true )

Hi [~devi.jampana@vodafone.com]

We have analyzed further and found that there is recent requirement over (https://jira.sp.vodafone.com/browse/OAF-690) [!https://bmcomviva.atlassian.net/images/icons/issuetypes/epic.svg!VFDED1FTS-5531: CR780 - Change of payment validation check for existing SEPA mandatIN DESIGN|https://bmcomviva.atlassian.net/browse/VFDED1FTS-5531] which is now available as part of the software where we are testing the above scenario.

As part the requirement we are now showing NOTIFICATION MODAL and disable ""Weiter"" button of payment section if the scenario we are performing meets below conditions.

System will validate if payment method = ""direct debit""
 * if yes: system will validate if IBAN = DE-IBAN

 ** if yes: system will validate if bank account owner (payer contact) = legal contact

Hi Gaurav,

For the blank data or no PayerAndPaymentInfo response issue +OS-52308+ /VFDEW82E2E-94 is handle via improvement ticket. ref +OAF-744+ VFDED1FTS-5844

 

this the ticket description and comment says issue (open issue is with when agent capture bank details (Bank account number 1241111    Sort Code 70050000)) was fixed with new version of code

Please schedule a meeting to discuss with ACC team. this looks to me 2 issues are mix in one ticket;;;","23/Apr/24 7:29 PM;ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com;[~bharath.krishnamurthy@vodafone.com]  the ticket OS-37304 was raised long time before OS-52308 but as long as OS-52308 is not closed we cannot check further on OS-37304

OS-37304 is different issue than OS-52308 but blocked by OS-52308

And we have explained the issue of OS-37304 several times since months, so issue here should be clear ;;;","25/Apr/24 3:22 PM;ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com;Further analysis blocked by [OAF-744] IMPR Omnius CHCK: As an Agent i wanted to update Payer Bank account validation in case of Cable order has giga products (e.g giga TV), so that giga tv orders will not stop in Omnius - Vodafone Global Jira;;;","29/Apr/24 12:59 PM;ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com;I am assigning it for now to me, as both Srujana and Harsha are not in anymore.

For this specific scenario still the flow is blocked. its not fixed by CR780/OAF-744 which was deployed today to ACC1

Steps to reproduce

1) Start new order entry for new customer, enter any GERMAN adress
2) Select KUD product from list e.g. Giga TV home Net 
3) proceed to checkout, residence information is displayed (OK)

!image-2024-05-16-14-18-29-777.png|width=1039,height=674!
4) Fill Checkout sections until IBAN section

+*IMPORTANT TO FOLLOW NOW EXACT STEPS*+

5) Click on credit card SYMBOL and enter Sort Code from a German bank institute e.g. 70050000 and any bank account number 

!image-2024-05-16-14-16-28-620.png|width=766,height=490!

6) click on ""Ermitteln"" -> automatically the system creates a valid GERMAN IBAN {color:#de350b}*(IT IS NOT A FOREIGN IBAN)*{color}

!image-2024-05-16-14-17-37-757.png|width=912,height=701!

7) Select Invoice adress and try to proceed -> Error is shown that there is foreign IBAN (WRONG, its GERMAN IBAN) or different invoice adress (WRONG, its not different)

!image-2024-05-16-14-19-58-501.png|width=1008,height=758!

The IBAN is a correct GERMAN IBAN - its just not typed in into the IBAN field but created automatically by the system when entering bank account number and sort code !!

we need to deliver a new package, as there were some new fixes as well
and I need to check what is wrong with the build pipeline
now I tried to build one more package, but still getting the same issue -
 it takes the build from April 17th instead of the one from May 2nd

we need to work on fixing the build pipeline
and then a new package will be delivered, after verifying that it contains all the latest components for sure

for temporary solution

The new OIL package for Wave 8.0 release is available: [https://nexus.dynacommercelab.com/repository/oil-packages/vfde/development/deployment/23.05.23.08001.zip]

The scope and content of it is exactly the same as was expected in 23.05.04.08001, but this time it is built correctly.

*RCA:* The package build is fully automated via Jenkins+Nexus. There are 3 repositories, on which a Jenkins pipeline runs and produces an artifact (partial package), which is then sent to Nexus storage. After building all partials, a final pipeline is run to collect all of them and create the full package. The problem is, that the query responsible for downloading a partial is limited to the first 50 items only, and for the most important repository, this number of files was reached on April 17th. A cleanup on Nexus was needed to let the pipeline download the latest available partial and include it in the package.

The permanent fix is to be done: we will need to either change the query to bypass the limit of 50 files, or introduce some regular (monthly) cleanup procedure to avoid the same issue in the future.;;;","23/May/23 12:55 PM;bharath.krishnamurthy@vodafone.com;[~emandi.kumari@vodafone.com]

Can you describe the current issue? What is being tried, what is expected, if it works in other envs, etc…? I understood from reading below that Netta provided a fix but no follow up after that, perhaps the thread continued offline. The last message to grasp on here is {_}“We are not able to find OGW logs as we don’t have order id details visible in SKY UI. So can not share the logs. Can you provide me the order id.“{_}.

 

 

Thanks,

Josh

Issue solved.

Opui is now more aligned with the other modules and will now redirect to https.

This is confirmed on 4000_WAVE8_2581 and will be merged EOD to the other current versions. Tomorrow, I can pass a list of branch_versions the fix is applied on.

 

If you need exact details for a HF to apply manually on ACC envs, pelase let me know.

[~natasa.dimovic1@vodafone.com] From OSE perspective implicitly we have restricted to enter special characters when typing to ease the validation. But there was not such requirement that we cannot enter special character .If we enter it should throw error banner. Please find the snippet from the US +OS-22158+

+!image-2023-05-19-15-17-36-581.png!+

Now we have inconsistent behaviour. If you type the special characters are not allowed. With copy + paste you can enter special characters.

As soon as we are able to test the complete E2E flow we will check if invalid Home IDs are really removed or if they can bee seen in the backend as well. Then I'll update this bug;;;","02/Jun/23 6:19 PM;natasa.dimovic1@vodafone.com;Retest on ACC1 – > Invalid HomeID is not entered. Retest passed, see attached logs

Environment: ACC1

Channel: Telesales + Retail

Test address: Am Seestern 10, 40547 Düsseldorf

HomeID examples (without replacing the vowels): 0I0IIIP, 0A0AADG, 123123O

 

+*Please note:*+ there are also examples where the vowels are not accepted:
 # AESHSRN (VWSHSRN)
 # A1A1A18 (V1V1V18)

      3. AHSHORS (VHSHYRS)

BUT for the 3rd examle it will, if you replace only the O – > AHSHYRS then it is not accepted, but if you replace only the A it is accepted – > VHSHORS 

 

{+}Actual result{+}: at the validation of the HomeID sometimes the vowels are accepted

 

{+}Expected result{+}: at the validation of the HomeID the vowels should be never accepted, they should be replaced with consonants

 

+Steps to reproduce:+

 
 * load the DTAG address ""Am Seestern 10, 40547 Düsseldorf"" on ACC1
 * click on ""Paktet hinzufügen >> DSL & Glasfaser Produkte""
 * select any DTAG tariff, e. g.: ""[R623.5000000526-24] GigaZuhause 1000 Glasfaser""

In this case the HomeID should be ""0X0XXXP"" (this is also accepted)

+Validation of the HomeID:+

!image-2023-05-19-12-18-25-238.png!

And the addon’s defined for this product has *I1203 and service expression is getting satisfied to true because FTTH_Telekom (FTTH-L2-BSA-DTAG) is present in the cart here, hence this adslInternetConfiguration is being sent*
|order.containsProductInCategoryId('FN143') == true or order.containsProductInCategoryId{*}('FN0454'){*} == true|

!image-2023-05-19-12-21-03-631.png!
 Similarly from the attached xml we also see I1208 with adsl and in multimapper addon’s condition satisfies to true

hence it is sent .

Finally for I1204

!image-2023-05-19-12-22-38-833.png!

the service expression defined as “order.containsProductInCategoryId('FN219') == true”

and again the cart had DTAG making this expression evaluated to true .so the add on value is being sent.

issue occurred due to wrong URL provided in BO.

Correct one: [https://osf-hprox2---------trieveAvailableShipping_Schemas.svc|https://osf-hprox2-acc1.vodafone.de:8008/Middleware.OIL.I18_RetrieveAvailableShipping.Wcf/WcfService_Middleware_OIL_I18_RetrieveAvailableShipping_Schemas.svc]

Changed: [https://osf-XXhprox2---------trieveAvailableShipping_Schemas.sv|https://osf-hprox2-acc1.vodafone.de:8008/Middleware.OIL.I18_RetrieveAvailableShipping.Wcf/WcfService_Middleware_OIL_I18_RetrieveAvailableShipping_Schemas.svc]

Added XX before *hprox*

and we are getting 502 proxy error beacuse we are changing the URL itself

but it we try

[https://osf-hprox2---------trieveAvailableShipping_Schemass.sv|https://osf-hprox2-acc1.vodafone.de:8008/Middleware.OIL.I18_RetrieveAvailableShipping.Wcf/WcfService_Middleware_OIL_I18_RetrieveAvailableShipping_Schemas.svc]

added ""{*}s{*}"" .svc no 502 error

so we shouldn't change the URL it self right from OSE BO, only modifying the service name will do the Fallback test.

Please check ;;;","31/May/23 4:10 PM;sneha.wayal1@vodafone.com;Retest passed with GASO fallback.

Hence closing this ticket.

I think the main question is:

-> in case of technical issues like ""Sim not available"" or ""cable backend down"" - is it expected that the sky ticket is not having data (and we are not taking about omnius order ID only but several information is missing). Is there any description/ design about the expected behavior or OGW and Sky for such technical issues? ;;;","05/Jun/23 5:31 PM;ran.farjun1@vodafone.com;Hi,
its depends on where the error is coming.
for example this error coming very early: No available resources found in OGW_VIRTUAL_SIM Table

 so in that case we dont have all the details to send to portal.

for this error: cable backend down: when i try this im getting more information on the ticket in portal. including Order Line Id and Omnius Order Id.

 

 

 ;;;","05/Jun/23 6:03 PM;ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com;[~ran.farjun1@vodafone.com]  so this means dependand from the time of error coming we have more or less information in the sky ticket, is this correct understanding?;;;","06/Jun/23 1:43 PM;ran.farjun1@vodafone.com;yes that's correct.;;;","07/Jun/23 12:40 PM;gokul.vade@vodafone.com;As discussed in Todays Defect call, it is an expected behavior.

[~natasa.dimovic1@vodafone.com]  its an existing behavior to display all available Glasfaser Regio-Klasse as per OS-904 since wave 4.3

And there was no requirement to change the logic for Glasfaser Regio-Klasse and Projekt-Referenz (Ausbaugebiet);;;","22/May/23 12:08 PM;natasa.dimovic1@vodafone.com;Hi [~vikash.saurav@vodafone.com] yes, there should be no change. So if GPON has the higher priority, the Glasfaser Regio-Klasse should be shown only for GPON. If DTAG has the higher priority, the Glasfaser Regio-Klasse should be shown only for DTAG. In that case BOTH are shown. In that case ONLY the Regio-Klasse for GPON should be shown. Could you please check that again?

[~natasa.dimovic1@vodafone.com]  Whatever Glasfaser Regio-Klasse, Projekt-Referenz (Ausbaugebiet) is available in serviceability response ,it has to *display all* is the behavior. there is no requirement to display on priority

We are excpecting that it should be similar with the other values. For the Projekt-Refrence ONLY 1 value is shown, not for GPON AND DTAG. That's why it should be the same behaviour for the Regio-Klasse"". Thanks;;;","22/May/23 2:01 PM;vikash.saurav@vodafone.com;[~natasa.dimovic1@vodafone.com]

 Divya is already conveyed the logic for *""Glasfaser Regio-Klasse:""* and ""Kooperationstyp: "". We have no considered any change for these 2 values, they are running on the logic defined earlier epic.

On this address GPON is available/ bookable, but the ""Projekt-Referenz (Ausbaugebiet)"" is showing the DTAG values, so something seems to be mixed up.

Here 1 example of a GPON address where the ""Projekt-Referenz"" is correct:

Hi Natasa

As said earlier this is the existing behavior similar to *Glasfaser Regio-Klasse even Projekt-Referenz (Ausbaugebiet): is displayed based on existing logic*

 

*!3ef38f5c-0fe1-4a8b-a1ee-ad0a1486c7ec.png!*

Already attached the reference of the ticket *OS-904* on the existing logic
 # In addition to the existing details below the towers new information will be displayed in an additional detailled information accordion ""Glasfaser Detailinformationen"".

 # Three new attributes + values must be displayed in the additional detailled information accordion

*""Glasfaser Regio-Klasse:"" [value from from availability service of AREA_CLASSIFICATION]* 
*(e.g. ""00"", ""01"",...,""09"")*
*""Projekt-Referenz (Ausbaugebiet): "" [value from availabilty service of PROJECT_REFERENCE]* 
*(e.g.""CELLE_2018_04"")*
""Kooperationstyp: "" [value from availability service of COOPERATION_TYPE]
(e.g. Gemeinde)
 #  

*The three new attributes can occur more than once in the CheckServiceability response with different values. Each unique value must be displayed once (comma separated) in the Detailed Overview accordion. The system will not display an identical value more than once.*

 # If IBAN =German means starts with prefix “DE” then system must by default enable BIC input field as mandatory input and system must allow to continue the sales flow when agent captures the BIC.
 # If IBAN is non German means not starts with prefix “DE” then system by default enable BIC input field and system must allow to continue the sales flow when agent captures the BIC(BAU).

For German IBANs the BIC validation (with OTF-724) should work like for non German IBANs (AS IS). Here Omnius validates BIC without calling IBAN service. 

So actual behavoir is not correct for BIC validation with German IBANs like described by Natasa.

Divya Kumbla added a comment - 
  when you see the options added in the cart ,the sliding calculator is 0 for these products hence forth you will not be seeing sliding charge as it considers it to be payable for entire contract(24 months).That's why it shows 1month to …
ideally if these components are for 12 months then sliding calculator should be 12.

the issue is with PCAT files.

this looks like to me a design gap.

DOB field was always mandatory when Agent perform search by customer data.

i guess when SOHO business customer type was introduce this was missed to make DOB to option over search page.

Lets schedule a short call togeher with VF desing team to finalize it.;;;","15/May/23 4:50 PM;sneha.wayal1@vodafone.com;Hi [~vikash.saurav@vodafone.com]

Steps to solve:-
 # Please do execute resetModules (file should be available in shell folder)

 # After reset Modules please do flush cache

Above two steps should solve the issue.

Issue happened because of duplicated data available in *ref_msisdn_structure* table. Where its will be static table which contains reference data .

Right now SOM version is 40.0 and OGW is having 36.0 version .

Order contains parameter AccessSupplier but OGG sends the order with version 36.0
<order orderID=""VDE7601608144"" somVersion=""36.0"" xmlns=http://www.arcor.net/orderSchema>
  <barcode>VDE7601608144</barcode>

But the parameter is introduce with version 40.0.

Hi Harsha,
 
What are steps/stack for this issues. Or this is for every stack. plz confirm.;;;","11/May/23 1:16 PM;singireddy.reddy@vodafone.com;Hi Bharat,

We are only interested in cable (Specifically Unitymedia) stack.

After placing an order in Unitymedia region, Once the order is completed Success and the status is reflected in the front end (Omnius), Please take the omnius order ID and search in Order manager and check for customer number (some times it could be Temp_ID or some times there is no customer number at all).

Regards,

Harsha

 ;;;","12/May/23 2:59 PM;bhavesh.renpara1@vodafone.com;Hi,

Ideally permanent account number only can be reflected in Omnius if OGW sends to us.

*I1010 - UpdateTemporaryCustomerID:​*
# This service pushes permanent customer ID from OGW to OSE.​
# OGW pushes message to amdocs.ogw.customerupdate queue.​
# I1010 service pulls message from this queue and puts in dyna.ose.setstatus queue.​
# status daemon pulls message from dyna.ose.setstatus queue and updates in table “catalog_package”->parent_account_number

So check and share the below logs to check if first OGW has sent permanent account number.
- OIL archive logs for service I1010. For the day when the permanent account number was pushed by OGW. 
- Status daemons logs to check further if received account number was  update.

[~bharath.krishnamurthy@vodafone.com] As far as i know process(mentioned above) for updating permanent account number at our end should same for Unity media as well. But you can double check with our BA.

As per my discussion with Rohan and Mattias, Rene and Tobias gonna check back if there is any such requirement on OGW to send the updated customerID to Omnius via ReplaceRempCustID message and raise a CR based on the need.

So, this cannot be a defect on OGW and need to be cancelled.

 # “eingeloggt bleiben” is translated in english as “stay logged in” which would not make sense in the current scenario .

 # “cancel” did not have a german translation

After the fix what should we expect about the ticket status in fraud_state table once agent is locked?
Like ticket should be automatically closed in fraud state table?  or should it remain in open state.

We need clarification on this, cause we perform it again(Agent id: 5225) and user got successfully locked and ticket status is marked as open. should it be automatically closed or not that is our doubt.

but in this case we are closing ticket manually, but still we aren't able to see sky ticket in UI.;;;","09/May/23 1:27 AM;nina.pickl@vodafone.com;Hi Akash, hi Netta,

there are two points:

-> regarding the automatic setting of the Sky Ticket in the database table fround_state from status OPEN to CLOSE , we already track this issue under OS-36341

-> regarding the sky ticket generation, in the logs the information seems to be fine :

              ""AgentID"":""4833"",
              ""DetectionTime"":""2023-05-04 10:51:35,420"",
              ""ThresholdCounter"":""80"",
              ""LockServiceName"":""LegacySearch"",

""LockDetails"":""Fraud attempt was detected and Ticket=FRAUD_4833_1683190295420 was created for Agent ID = 4833 with Service Name =  LegacySearch. Time Stamp = 2023-05-04 10:51:35,420,Lock was Done Successfully""

Only regarding 'its not a ticket that you can see' - my understandig from the EPIC description is also that the fraund ticket should be checked by operation directly in the log files. I just want to confirm it with business to be 100% sure that no Sky Ticket in the UI is expected, therefore the Bug is now assigned to me.

 ;;;","11/May/23 12:55 PM;nina.pickl@vodafone.com;After clarification with Thorsten Lehnert- the display of the Fraud tickets work as required- the corresponding Log Files are available for the handling by operations team. The Acceptance Criteria are fulfilled:

!image-2023-05-11-09-26-01-423.png!

 

Therefore I will cancel this Bug- no display required in the SKY UI.

The duplicate values are not a problem.

But the 'Line Number' is missing for UPDATE + REMOVE -> the parameter is needed to resolve DSL and cable tickets. Otherwise, the clearing team will not be able to solve the tickets and the order will have to be canceled and set up again (call the client and create a completely new order) -> therefore it is a blocker issue from clearing point of view

Hello! This is our input requested from the last call :
For the submit order flow, we have the following three services: submit order, send document and support order .
 # In case the submitOrder service fails (can't submit the order to the queue), we don't call supportOrder and sendDocument

 # In case the supportOrder service fails (can't connect to OIL or some sort of technical error) , we create a manualWorkItem and call sendDocument either way

 The order of the service calls are : submitOrder, supportOrder, sendDocument, sendProcessFeedback .
 In case they all get executed successfully, depending on the configuration, we also trigger the UCT report .

""C_basic"" or ""C_comfort"" are already existing options. They are booked with DSL and FIBER GPON as well.

+Example GPON:+
 * load the address: Am Seestern 430, Düsseldorf
 * select any GPON tariff, e. g.: ""[R219.5000000014-24] GigaZuhause 1000 Glasfaser""

--> in ""Optionen"" the option ""[C_basic] Basis-Anschluss"" is preselected. Optionally ""[C_comfort] Komfort-Anschluss"" could be selected. If ""[C_comfort] Komfort-Anschluss"" is selected ""[C_basic] Basis-Anschluss"" is deselected:

!image-2023-05-08-15-11-42-895.png!

It is not possible to create a DSL/ FIBER order without ""[C_comfort] Komfort-Anschluss"" OR ""[C_basic] Basis-Anschluss""

Hello [~natasa.dimovic1@vodafone.com]  , just checked the issue

As per the multimapper defined if we have C_basic in the cart along with other tariff ,the tivano option addon 's gets added based on the service expression

If cart has C_basic ,TivanoOptionSku is included in SystemAdditionalData only if the service expression satisfies to true

so if the service expression below is satisfied

order.containsProductInCategoryId('FN78') == true and (order.containsProductInCategoryId('FN142') == true or order.containsProductInCategoryId('FN220') == true)

then below is sent in submit order request

<SystemAdditionalData>
<SystemName>FN</SystemName>
<AttributeCode>TivanoOptionSku</AttributeCode>
<AttributeValue>VI002</AttributeValue>
<AttributeAdditionalValue>Tivano/product/option</AttributeAdditionalValue>

</SystemAdditionalData>

!image-2023-05-12-13-04-04-968.png!

Here you see the value going for GPON because, FTTH-GPON belongs to ('FN220') category !image-2023-05-12-13-04-31-124.png!

(C_basic mapped to FN78 category and FTTH-GPON is mapped to FN220 category)

Shruti Kanchan added a comment - Home-ID is a optional field so it must be possible to continue when agent has entered an invalid home-id. There should be an error message shown to the agent that Home-ID is invalid and agent will proceed ahead and system won’t store a record of invalid home-id. Entering invalid Home-ID won’t stop the flow.

As per OS-26885 we are supposed to display both upstream and downstream for *all fibre technology* in Serviceability tab (Refer UI Screen)

!image-2023-05-22-18-49-17-869.png!

So in response we are receiving fibre technology with multiple bandwidth and same is shown .IF atleast one fibre technology has GRUEN as availlability indicator then we show a green dot against the downstream/upstream value else it is red

!image-2023-05-22-18-49-45-498.png!

and still we have in the response.;;;","22/May/23 7:25 PM;natasa.dimovic1@vodafone.com;Hi [~vikash.saurav@vodafone.com] in that case you can see a red bubble next to up- and downstream.

I expected that it will be like for ""Glasfaser Regio-Klasse"" and for the ""Projekt-Referenz (Ausbaugebiet)"" the field are there but without values. Why is this a different behaviour? Thanks

[~amruta.chougule@vodafone.com]  if we see the OGW getProductavailability response we received, we have FTTH-GPON providing the highest bandwidth with priority 1,hence forth it considers FTTH GPON not the FTTH-DTAG .

we show access_supplier and rollout status only if DTAG has the highest priority

If its GPON address then GPON product should get selected.

Hi [~amruta.chougule@vodafone.com] 

1.Display of information in the i icon is based on the highest bandwidth provided by service provider, in this scenario GPON has highest bandwidth.

2.The display of fibre tariff is decided based on the rules defined ,there is this rule which is listing dtag tariff in configurator.

ideally response should have correct availability .

!image-2023-05-09-12-58-27-097.png!

3. coming to project reference ,All the project references present in response should be displayed in information tab

please refer OS-529 for the existing functionality understanding

GPON is having , AvailabilityIndicator = GRAU . so means GPON is not available at all on this address . So DTAG related details should be there in Information section.

[~amruta.chougule@vodafone.com]  The existing logic is the access provider having the highest bandwidth will be considered to display relevant details in information tab and if 2 access provider has same higher bandwidth then it check priority.

Scenario 1:To get DTAG details in i information tab DTAG should provide highest bandwidth

eg: DTAG 1000 Mbits/s,GPON 500Mbits/s then DTAG will be shown

Scenario 2:

if DTAG and GPON has same bandwidth ,then priority will be checked

eg DTAG 1000 Mbits/s with priority 1 ,GPON Mbits/s with priority 2 then DTAG will be shown

DTAG 1000 Mbits/s with priority 2 ,GPON Mbits/s with priority 1 then GPON will be shown;;;","11/May/23 7:39 PM;amruta.chougule@vodafone.com;Mail sent to BA for further clarification.;;;","11/May/23 8:57 PM;natasa.dimovic1@vodafone.com;Hi [~vikash.saurav@vodafone.com] 

If DTAG and GPON has same bandwidth, then priority will be checked, +*but the colour must be considered as well*+ (existing behaviour):

examples for new-activation-scenarios:
 # GPON 1000 Prio 1 (GRUEN); DTAG 1000 Prio 2 (GRUEN) -> Availability Details GPON, Configurator: GPON Tariffs
2. GPON 1000 Prio 1 (GRAU); DTAG 1000 Prio 2 (GRUEN) -> Availability Details DTAG, Configurator: DTAG Tariffs
3. DTAG 1000 Prio 1 (GRUEN); GPON 1000 Prio 2 (GRUEN) -> Availability Details DTAG, Configurator: DTAG Tariffs
4. DTAG 1000 Prio 1 (GRAU); GPON 1000 Prio 2 (GRUEN) -> Availability Details GPON, Configurator: GPON Tariffs

Could it be that in that case the colour is not considered?

Thanks!;;;","12/May/23 6:16 PM;vikash.saurav@vodafone.com;hi [~natasa.dimovic1@vodafone.com]  we already discussed  this with amruta over call and you can latest comment from divya

 

[~amruta.chougule@vodafone.com]  please help natasha ;;;","15/May/23 1:59 PM;natasa.dimovic1@vodafone.com;Hi [~vikash.saurav@vodafone.com]  as discussed with [~shruti.kanchan@vodafone.com] 

in this US it is described that the colours should be also mentioned: https://jira.sp.vodafone.com/browse/OS-22159

The Rule for ""Glasfaser Regio-Klasse:"" and ""Projekt-Referenz (Ausbaugebiet):""

should be the same like for the Access_Supplier and the Rollout Status, but it is unfortunately not like that.

Here again the example:

Am Seestern 10, Düsseldorf

GPON has the higher priority but it is ""GRAY""

DTAG has the lower priority but it is ""GREEN""

!image-2023-05-15-10-25-22-578.png!

""{*}Glasfaser Regio-Klasse:{*}"" is displayed correct – > DTAG

""{*}Projekt-Referenz (Ausbaugebiet):{*}"" is displayed correct – > DTAG

""{*}Downstream/Upstream (in Mbit/s):{*}"" is displayed wrong --> GPON (this could be because of a different rule or because of the bug: [OS-36380] OSF | Wave 8.0 | ACC1 | OS-17997 | not available bandwith is displayed for DTAG in Downstream/Upstream - Vodafone Global Jira )

""{*}Access Supplier{*}"" is not dsplayed at all 

""{*}Rollout Status{*}"" is not dsplayed at all 

Could you please check that again?

Thanks!

Shruti Kanchan added a comment - - Discussions were around colour priority, we’ll need a joint call with VF again to discuss the same. The story in particular did not have requirement for filtering colour priority.

In the US: OS-26885 it is mentioned the following:

Could you please check if the implementation is done corresponding to 1000 MBits? In the logs you can see that in that case DTAG has a higher priority than GPON for 1000 MBits.

So team will change back to earlier behaviour to reduce the impact on our testing. They will inform us once they have discussed with development - target date is end of next week

 

However - OTF-1054 will not be solved by this rollback and TechM still has to work on it.

[~bhavesh.renpara1@vodafone.com] has discussed with [~nicusor.vintan@vodafone.com]  and [~philippe.bretan@vodafone.com]  for this defect.

 

*Action Point:*

[~nicusor.vintan@vodafone.com] will close this  defect.

 

Few technical conclusions from the meeting for DXL API.
 * Now this issue is not there, maybe there was temporary cable backend issue. So, ticket can be closed.
 * Omnius API will continue to send 500 http status code to client(DXL at this moment) in case of any such {*}exception at backend (OGW or next system){*}. Error message would be the once, received from BE.
 * Omnius API will continue to send 500 http status code to client(DXL at this moment) in case of any Omnius internal exception. è This point was not discussed in call, but this is the current behavior for 5XX errors by Omnius API servers to client.
 * Current Omnius behavior is as per the expectation by client, so will not do any further SW changes in Omnius API/OSE SW for error code handling.

 I tried to replicate the error scenario on my local as well as ST environment but enable to get such error.
I can notice, the given agent’s wrong login attempt is more then configured Wrong Password Attempts but still the agent is not locked.

Current Scenario (Happy scenario) : If agent try to login with wrong password till configured Wrong Password Attempts then login attempt increase and agent will locked.

If we unlock the agent then the login attempt reset to Zero.

So now on ACC, Login attempt is more than configured Wrong Password Attempts and agent is unlocked, ideally this not suppose to be happen.

The point is are we using some default database (seed) in which this wrong data is present.

And I believe there is User Management script which correcting/adjusting data, So are we using that on ACC env.

Hi Taher,

Can you Please clear the cache from Back office, then you can test the above scenario on ACC now with the given Credential.

if it is working fine, then need to do the same configuration in BO settings for your credentials also, for that we need your credentials details.;;;","26/Apr/23 4:30 PM;taher.golvala@vodafone.com;Points discussed during the today's call:

ACC team observation: 

We still had a few users which were facing issue and getting error in Retail FI agent at the time of selecting shop.

After Locking and unlocking/ Resetting the user seems solved the issue but with the workaround.

We also cleared cache from BO with the help of TID team.

This was never observed in past ACC testing hence Requested Tech M Team to check and debug for the same.;;;","28/Apr/23 5:14 PM;bharath.krishnamurthy@vodafone.com;[~taher.golvala@vodafone.com] [~ajay.bhavar@vodafone.com] [~ajay.yashwantbhavar@vodafone.com] [~gokul.vade@vodafone.com] [~ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com] [~dadasaheb.narbat@vodafone.com]

Hi All,
 
If a user enters an incorrect password multiple times and reaches the configured limit, the agent will become locked and inactive with a suspension reason. Simply unlocking the agent will not make it work again; the user must also activate it. This is the current behavior of BO.;;;","03/May/23 1:23 PM;taher.golvala@vodafone.com;Today while performing test one of the user is facing this issue again please find below the user details

And the message is for {{Checks if an agent has any of the permissions to search a shop}}

Since the respective agent don’t have permission so that why they are getting this error message which correct. !image-2023-05-09-11-30-14-076.png!!image-2023-05-09-11-30-33-376.png!

RCA : 
There might be possibility while unlocking agent, admin don't follow all step likes Unlocking the Agent, Activating the agent, Clearing login Attempt and Clearing locking reason. Because of which the attempt was keep increasing and showing wrong message.

Please find below MOM points shared by Defect management team:

This issue has been discussed with ACC Test Team, OGW Dev, EAI, SBUS, OM and Infra Team.
After analysis from SBUS/OM logs, we have identified that SBUS is sending callback and no error found in SBUS logs.
We have involved EAI Team to check further flow, but logs not found in EAI Logs.
Hence, just to try, ACC Test Team ask TID team to restart complete WS servers.
WS servers restart activity is completed, and ACC Test team is performing test scenario to check CS issue, but still same issue occurred.

As discussed with [~rohan.kumbhar@vodafone.com], We will check this issue with changing SBUS/ROM backend from PR to IT and observe the issue, if it's occurring same in IT env.;;;","24/Apr/23 6:14 PM;vikash.saurav@vodafone.com;[~sneha.wayal1@vodafone.com] [~ketaki.bhide1@vodafone.com] [~ajay.yashwantbhavar@vodafone.com]

 I go through the error message and OSE code and I think it is not OSE code level issue. We need to check DealerCode is valid or not on ACC env only because this issue is not replicable on ST or nor on my local env. You also need to check agent against shop.

As per initial analysis i assume that the area code has leading 0's. so the system is throwing an error stating Area code mismatch.

As we cannot change the area code as the reference number given during Move is greyed out. 

One more observation is that the system is taking more than one number as reference during move. 

As per the below CR , system should only take  one number as reference.

;;;","30/Mar/23 3:20 PM;ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com;Feedback from Jörg:

We might need a fix on this because unitymedia is not acceping a phone number with an area code which is outside unitymedia region

Option 1: OSF übergibt keine Telefonnummern mehr bei „Move“ = Problem gelöst

Option 2: Cablemaster gibt keine Fehlermeldung mehr wenn bei „Move“ die Variante Ohne Portierung VF_UMZUG_{*}OP{*} übertragen wird aber dennoch (z.B. Münchener) Nummern drin sind als Trigger diese alle bei VKD zu kündigen.

It is not clear if Cablemaster needs the phone number for processing or not

We are checking now with one phone number only, if same issue happens ;;;","30/Mar/23 9:15 PM;ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com;As per analysis this issue also happens with 1 phone number also

so it has to be fixed - but not sure if on Unitymedia side or in OSF - I asked Monique to check

Hi all,

between Monday 12.06. and Friday 16.06. we are able to test the following defect for unitymedia:

[OS-33582] OSF | ACC2 | Move offnet from VKD to UM | ERROR. -115025: CM-APIPKG0036 - ERROR: Vorwahl für Telefonnummer (1) ist ungültig. - Vodafone Global Jira

As there is only very limited time please start your tests on Monday (I think backend switch to UAT06 might take place in regular outage window). We also need some additional regression checks for the following scenarios, as the validation of the phone number to be ported will be removed completely for Unity:

DSL Migration unity with porting
Move VKD E2E to be sure nothing is broken here (1 scenario is enough)
New unity customer with porting
New unity customer without porting 

Please prepare your customer data for the tests,  if needed. In case of any issues please let me know as soon as possible as we do not have so much time to fix things.

Thanks and regards, Ari

In the checkout in the order overview before creation of contract summary the one time charge section is missing. 
4Rufnummern is only shown with 0 Euro which is correct for MONTHLY charge – but there is no one time charge section.

!image-2023-03-06-19-52-01-988.png!

Therefore it is also missing on the contract summary

There is a very old defect where this fee was missing on the contract summary only, but part of the order overview. There you can see it was working in the past.

One time charge can be seen in the Order Overview but not in the contract summary and in case of retail in both contract summary and contract document.

Please look into the below screenshots.

1) Order confirmation from Cablemaster, do we see the one time charges here?

2) I am not sure if we tried the same for new customers, I think also for new customers with more than 3 numbers it will be wrong, correct?

 

I think CS takes the prices from the shopping cart and at the time of shopping cart we do not know about these one time charges. They are added in the checkout only;;;","09/May/23 5:36 PM;singireddy.reddy@vodafone.com;Hi [~ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com]  We do see the OTC in in the order confirmation from cablemaster.

I will let you know about the second point ASAP.

Notice that in the sceenshots above the ""4RUFNUMMERN"" is present on the contract summary, this product is also only added in the checkout.



I described my current assumption of the issue in the following ticket: [https://de.jira.agile.vodafone.com/browse/PSTASH-965];;;","11/May/23 4:29 PM;ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com;Thanks for your feedback Simon - then we do not need new requirement here :)

Harsha;;;","23/May/23 7:47 PM;ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com;[~singireddy.reddy@vodafone.com]  can you please share your retest results?;;;","25/May/23 1:42 PM;simon.auch@vodafone.com;This was retestet by team Ash as part of the following ticket: [[PSTASH-965] [OSF] Number porting fees not shown in contract summary - DE Jira (vodafone.com).|https://de.jira.agile.vodafone.com/browse/PSTASH-965]

During analysis we found out that the products are now shown on the contracts summary, but they are not shown correctly (the contract summary is for the product 1V1, but the same issue appears for UMP4/5/6): [^contract_summary_1v1.pdf]
Notice that 1V1 (""Einmalige Vor-Ort-Installationspauschale für Digitalen Kabelanschluss"") is shown under the section ""Monatliche Zahlungen"" while it is a product that is configured to only have a one time charge of 99.99€. Also notice that the sums for the sections ""Einmalige Zahlungen"" and ""Monatliche Zahlungen"" is still correct.

Interestingly the display in the checkout overview is correct.

I already contacted OM and requested the CS input xml from them: [^3140_ContractSummary_PK_Cab_xmlOriginal.xml]

Notice the entry for 1V1 mentions a monthly price:
{code:java}
<Fees><Name>Einmalige Vor-Ort-Installationspauschale für Digitalen Kabelanschluss</Name><PriceInfo><SlidingPrice><StartingMonth>1</StartingMonth><MonthlyPriceNoTax>84.0252</MonthlyPriceNoTax><MonthlyPriceIncTax>99.99</MonthlyPriceIncTax></SlidingPrice></PriceInfo></Fees> {code}
After searching through the request archive on the ACC1 I found the following entry (OSE -> OIL):
[https://deosaahw.internal.vodafone.com/Archive/I09/2023/5/22/WSManager/Request/702077_08c1155b-9641-4e55-8550-a3248eb2b757_Request_9a376373-3df3-4f08-9d8a-f396ce687f1c.xml]

Notice the entry for 1V1 mentions a ""LinePaymentInterval"" REC instead of OTC (one time charge):
{code:java}
<dlc:CommercialProduct><dlc:LineActivityType>ADD</dlc:LineActivityType><dlc:LinePaymentInterval>REC</dlc:LinePaymentInterval><dlc:LineRecurrringChargePeriod/><dlc:PackageSubType>ConfigurableCheckoutOptions</dlc:PackageSubType><dlc:PackageTypeID>cable_tv</dlc:PackageTypeID><dlc:ProductType>simple</dlc:ProductType><dlc:ProductName><![CDATA[ Einmalige Vor-Ort-Installationspauschale für Digitalen Kabelanschluss ]]></dlc:ProductName><dlc:FreightRate>0.00</dlc:FreightRate><dlc:ProductDescription>[1V1] Vor-Ort-Installationspauschale</dlc:ProductDescription><dlc:ProductLaunchDate>1900-01-01</dlc:ProductLaunchDate><dlc:SkuId>1V1</dlc:SkuId><dlc:DeviceID/><dlc:LineTaxClass>TAX_19</dlc:LineTaxClass><dlc:AdvancedBaseFee>N</dlc:AdvancedBaseFee><dlc:AutomaticProlongation>0</dlc:AutomaticProlongation><dlc:FreightRateNetPrice>0.00</dlc:FreightRateNetPrice><dlc:PriceInfo><dlc:StartPeriod>1</dlc:StartPeriod><dlc:EndPeriod/><dlc:NetPrice>84.0252</dlc:NetPrice><dlc:GrossPrice>99.9900</dlc:GrossPrice><dlc:LineTaxClass>TAX_19</dlc:LineTaxClass></dlc:PriceInfo><dlc:Bandwidth> </dlc:Bandwidth><dlc:ScopeList><dlc:Scope>ContractSummary</dlc:Scope></dlc:ScopeList></dlc:CommercialProduct> {code}
 

 

This issue can be reproduced by creating a new customer order at the following address:
{code:java}
<ns2:Strasse>Theresienthaler Str.</ns2:Strasse>
<ns2:Hausnummer>20</ns2:Hausnummer>
<ns2:Hausnummerzusatz>b</ns2:Hausnummerzusatz>
<ns2:Ort>Zwiesel</ns2:Ort>
<ns2:PLZ>94227</ns2:PLZ> {code}
Ordering any GigaTv tariff and selecting ""technician needed yes"" in the checkout should be sufficient to have 1V1 in the shopping cart.

 

[~singireddy.reddy@vodafone.com] can you please either assign this Ticket to TechM or create a new issue for this?;;;","25/May/23 2:25 PM;ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com;Current assumption:
 * Option should be shown now on the CS document but in wrong section (monatliche instead of einmalige)
 * Correction required to show the option with the price in one time charge section
 * Issue: ""LinePaymentInterval"" is shown as REC instead of OTC

 

harsha, please check if you can see the fee for 4-6. phone number on the CS now.

Then maybe we can close this defect and open a new one to correct the section where it should be shown ;;;","30/May/23 3:31 PM;ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com;[~singireddy.reddy@vodafone.com]  please share your results here and look at my last comment;;;","30/May/23 4:04 PM;singireddy.reddy@vodafone.com;will share an update as soon as possible.;;;","31/May/23 6:49 PM;singireddy.reddy@vodafone.com;Retest started DSL customer number : FN_001905946036;;;","31/May/23 6:53 PM;singireddy.reddy@vodafone.com;!image-2023-05-31-18-53-53-810.png!;;;","31/May/23 7:03 PM;singireddy.reddy@vodafone.com;!image-2023-05-31-19-02-06-573.png!

 ;;;","01/Jun/23 11:51 AM;ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com;[~singireddy.reddy@vodafone.com] I am not sure about your result because you did not comment the screenshots.

However, I can see that the charge is visible on the Contract summary but in the wrong section. Its currently in Monatliche Zahlungen but has to be in a One Time Charge sections.

-> This original defect can be closed as it was about missing completely on the CS. Now its visible

-> Please open a new defect: One time fee for porting of additional phone numbers is displayed in the wrong section on the contract summary (and on contract document as well, right?). You can mark it as critical defect and assign to TechM - something seems to be wrong in the value """"LinePaymentInterval"" -> its given as REC instead of OTC
Please check the submit order request for generate contract I think there the logs from Simon are coming from

It is not causing trouble for production as CR498 is inactive in production! Also on ACC2 it is not active, there the jobs are running fine.

 

Yesterday manual import and publish (NO CHANGES) was done on ACC1 with CR498 activated - and this was successfully finished. Solstice as well as legacy products have been visible in configurator on ACC1.

In the afternoon we activated CR498, changed Mobile PCAT and overnight import is still running.

As part of implementation of Z_SRT02126640A(enhancements in plm process logging) a check was added that based on logfile name it was determined if we are in a auto-import scenario. This was not a correct implementation since for auto import we are triggering the plm.php job with stack=Auto. Then after checking the files which are missing we are internally triggering the process again with i.e. stack=Mobile ( incase mobile is missing). The name of the logfile doesnt change, this resulted in attempting to do the autoimport file comparison again, however this time it fails since we didnt retrieve the files. Hence the autoimport fails.

TLDR: Z_SRT02126640A broke it.;;;","27/Mar/23 5:14 PM;ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com;This change Z_SRT02126640A was deployed to ACC in October 2022 with CN_17082  
I think the last test with CR498 active was some months before that timeframe and we did not know, that this change has effect on CR498. 

 

However, I think we would need an improvement in CR498 functionality right?
Therefore I assign it to Thorsten for further clarification.

Testing has to be planned after Wave 8.0 Go Live now. ;;;","03/Apr/23 2:02 PM;ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com;[~thorsten.meyer02@vodafone.com]  can you please let me know how to proceed?

I think there are only two options:

1) Production change SRT is removed but I do not think that it is possible or useful after such a long time
2) A new change is set up to correct CR498 functionality?

ACtually I am not sure what this fix here was about - we did not deploy it because we were running out of time. So not sure if this fix was already one of the options. Please check with TechM and let us know the next steps.
Please keep in mind we have to plan a new separate test slot for it.

Mirel's expectation was that it should be implemented for both VVL and ILS.

After going live from the release W7.2, he will check it in PROD and contact TechM about improvement story for VVL.

in production the same behaviour appears.

Now is in clarification between Mirel & TechM, if the case 'Prolongation with Discount' will be delivered as a Fix for this Bug.

If yes- then we will just retest this Bug (Search Customer with Discount -> check in shopping cart 1. for VVL if the Discount is not deleted 2. For Tariff Change if the discount is not deleted).

We don't need to create any Jira test cases.

I will inform you asap, if and when we will get the fix.;;;","28/Feb/23 2:48 PM;nina.pickl@vodafone.com;After confirmation by Mirel, Clearing Team, TechM- the number of the faced errors in Production after Release is very small, it will make no sense to trigger an improvment story, therefore we can close the Bug

 We have verified the log and we see couple of orders here

one XsellMob on DSL and another XsellCable on DSL ,for both this will be a new ACQ Mob and Cable respectively

from submit order the details go as expected ,in the send order request as well I see customer number going

XsellMob on DSL

but even after sending the customer number ,OM doesn’t display

!image-2023-02-06-12-06-54-826.png!!image-2023-02-06-12-07-14-293.png!

Its not an OSE issue;;;","06/Feb/23 2:52 PM;oliver.lampert1@vodafone.com;Natasa has checked different test cases when customerID is appearing on contract (sent to OM).

It looks like that for every xSell use case  customerID is sent as '0000000000'. Cause is, that TechM is handling it like new ACQ for new stack.

Has to be clarified with Design Team.

[~robert.goebbels@vodafone.com]: Can you please check from your side?;;;","07/Feb/23 2:19 PM;oliver.lampert1@vodafone.com;Clarification meeting planned for today.;;;","08/Feb/23 3:25 PM;oliver.lampert1@vodafone.com;Still in discussion with Astrid Hilder and Design team.

Follow-up call planned for tomorrow.

Especially impact on x-Sell scenario has to be evaluated.;;;","10/Feb/23 2:19 PM;oliver.lampert1@vodafone.com;With decision on 9th February from Demand Management (Astrid Hilder) and DT3 it is accepted to GoLive with this bug. 

Root Cause for different behaviour of printing customerID on OM side is different handling of customerID dependent on length of customerID.

1) Dummy customer numbers (zeros) with 9 and 12 chars are lead to suppressing of printing. (example above XsellMob on DSL)

2) Dummy customer numbers (zeros) with 10,11, 13 chars are not covered and lead to printing. (example XsellCable on DSL)

For second case CU for change on OM side is needed.

Expectation: In case of xSell customerNumber should not appear on introduction letter because of new contract.

Magnus takes care.

Defect will stay open until CU is ready and RFA declared. Retest necessary.;;;","14/Feb/23 3:50 PM;oliver.lampert1@vodafone.com;CU on OM side was created by Magnus Klöker:

“Dummy customer numbers (zeros) with 10,11, 13 chars are not covered and lead to printing. (example XsellCable on DSL)“

Therefore the CU was implemented to take care that such customer numbers (in this case for cable XSell) are not printed any more.

,as we are receiving the status from OGW for CS_aborted and also rewrite the actual result .it implies OSE is displaying incorrect status.but issue here is why we are receiving CS_aborted for this offer

 please refer OS-4553 which says the offer status CS_aborted is sent by OGW but not omnius’s internal status

please find the snippets of this storyc

and also refer OS-4106,OS-4552
 # The customer has declined the contract summary (Omnius receives contract summary status as ""Aborted"") (refer to OS-4552 user story for offer status update).

I guess we also discussed already in the call that OGW is sending us the CS_aborted status hence forth we update the same in omnius DB

If it is related to pushofferstatus request csstatus then it is not OGW issue.

[~natasa.dimovic@vodafone.com]  once a we receive CS_aborted from external system(OM or OGW) we update the status of that offer to CS_Aborted ,So offer will have only one status at a time. CS_Superceded will be overridden by CS_aborted as the latest status send by external system is CS_aborted

there is no question of deciding which status to show, whatever status is available in DB we show the same. Offer holds only one status at a time.

*1st issue:* 

When changing/ replacing an offer:
 # Change/ Replace offer in *360 view* with „{*}Bearbeiten{*}” – > 1st CS ID has the Omnius status ""{color:#00875a}*CS_Superseded*{color}"" - > *OK* (see new updated Word document)
 # Change/ Replace offer with click on „{*}Konfiguration{*}” (go back) – > 1st CS ID has the Omnius status ""{color:#00875a}*CS_Superseded*{color}"" - > *OK* (see new updated Word document)
 # Change/ Replace with click on „{*}Zurück zum Checkout{*}” – > 1st CS ID has the Omnius status ""{color:#de350b}*CS_Aborted*{color}"" – > *NOT OK* (see bug description)

Why the behavior is different fo the 3rd case?

*2nd issue:*

From our understanding the Omnius status ""CS_Aborted"" was implemented with EECC that the customer should have the possibility to reject the Contract Summary via E-Mail. But this was never used, its just implemented and 'dead code'! The customer can only accept the Contract Summary OR the Contract Summary will get the status ""CS_Timeout"" after some time (depending on the configuration) if the Contract Summary was not accepted.

If this is the case, then the Omnius status CS_Aborted should never be shown. ;;;","09/Feb/23 6:18 PM;aliriza.celebi@vodafone.com;[~yatindra.naidu@vodafone.com] scheduled call for 10-02-23 ;;;","10/Feb/23 4:11 PM;yatindra.naidu@vodafone.com;*Hi All,*

I already initiated one mail towards TEMS and later they fwd this amil to Lac from OM develoepemnt.

Our observation :- Only DB is showing status null but all the remaining systems are shwoing status SENT.
So as per Gerd, it looks that the update between Ignite Cache and OMDB CR instance is not working correct.
;;;","22/May/23 3:52 PM;gokul.vade@vodafone.com;Hello All,

As per the Gerd and Lac - This is the expected behavior of OM DB and status is in Dashbaord is the correct one.;;;","22/May/23 6:24 PM;gerd.angress@vodafone.com;Die Logik im OM Dashboard für die Historienanzeige basiert auf einer eigenen Interpretation und hat nichts mit dem Status in OM DB zu tun.
So you see only the current status from OMDB. The shown history status is defined by the sequence of the CR process. 
Therefore the ticket can be closed.

Bas Smeets added comment as-


The problem is with options prices that are calculated using mixmatch the maf price goes to zero, so there is no maf price on the item.

In current code we are sending all these options which go to 0 maf as OTC price. This is the same for production code on release/9.14.7

The logic  for options is followed that if no prices are applied and also no discounts are applied(mixmatch is not discount) then we will check if the product is visible (any visibility) then we will send OTC, in case not visible or value “not shown” we will send the REC price.

Im not sure if the expectation is valid here since we are sending OTC also in prod code, this was never a concern.

Since both prices are 0 (maf and price) based on what should the maf even be send? Should it be based on the original product price? This would be a new logic.

could you please check above comment and confirm

 

 ;;;","31/Jan/23 9:54 PM;astrid.hilder@vodafone.com;Hi all, 

Lukas asked me if I can check above mentioned comment as well. From my point of view the misunderstanding lies in current behavior for option prices that a 0 Euro maf is interpreted as ""no maf price"" and therefore is sending as 0 Euro OTC. 

As above mentioned: ""The problem is with options prices that are calculated using mixmatch the maf price goes to zero, so there is no maf price on the item. In current code we are sending all these options which go to 0 maf as OTC price.""

But from my point of view this behavior is not correct because the monthly price for a monthly charged option can also be zero. It is definately wrong to show an option with monthly service and monthly price as ""one time charge"" on contract summary because such an option will be shown every month on the customer bill (with 0 Euro monthly price).

Maybe the mixmatch rules need to be changed... ?

Best regards, Astrid (sorry);;;","01/Feb/23 9:26 PM;sunil.kumar3@vodafone.com;[~amruta.chougule@vodafone.com]

Timo Hurai 

From my point of view, this is a reject. 

The reasons for this are:

 The logic to sent OTC in case the ‘price’ and ‘maf’ is 0, is already in code for 1,5 years. 

The logic that is 1,5 year in code was never a problem 

There was never a requirement to for example look if there was a ‘price’ or ‘maf’ set for a product before applying the Mixmatch. 

We are 1 day before code freeze so adopting the code now last minute is risky and might impact other scenario’s.

If this needs to be improved, then we could either log an internal improvement or address this to VF and wait for the requirement. ;;;","07/Feb/23 6:33 PM;aliriza.celebi@vodafone.com;[~amruta.chougule@vodafone.com]

This behavior should be fine.

I dont think we should remove the previous error banner if a new error banner is created.

I do not see any specific requirements telling to only show error banner of more then once is clicked.

As discussed in Telco together with @Bas Smeets @Abhishek Goyal @KP Lavanya Rani 

Well this is not a defect and must be rejected. The current behaviour of banner is working as per US definition.

In my opinion we need an improvement to this banner notification in generic manner. 
Within Omnius current solution we have two level of banner.
1. Section level (based on User action)
2. System level (top of applicaiton UI; where system/software took an action in background)

So these User action result in error than banner must be shown on section level.;;;","07/Feb/23 2:24 PM;aliriza.celebi@vodafone.com;*Please continue investigation, but Solstice will be fixed in SIT*, add Fix version Wave 8.0 added, ;;;","15/Feb/23 9:08 PM;daniel.loos1@vodafone.com;[~taher.golvala@vodafone.com] please close the ticket as resolution is ""won't fix"".

Migration team can be helpful here. MRT is designed in discussion with them and Legacy Ids are maintained the way it is agreed upon.

As far as i know, at Customer service desk, UM Customer is always asked the Region/state they come from. This is asked due to the fact that the same identifier can be present in 3 regions and it is important to distinguish the actual customer record.;;;","23/Jan/23 10:19 PM;ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com;if you need more details how index search for unity is implemented you can get in touch with  [~thomas.schneider1@vodafone.com]

  expected result is not agreed as per design. 
in sales order only one DSL stack package is allowed, means one package with one service address
and Omnius solution doesn’t support multple service address for one Single order.

Same behaviour is applicable for Cable stack package (KIP and KUD)

[~natasa.dimovic@vodafone.com]  once the offer is created ,we update the offer status to CS_Created (VZ angefordert) which is updated in DB as well.

once we receive update status from PushofferStatus with Sent (sent by OGW/OM not sure)then DB is updated to CS_Pending(VZ an Kunden versendet) then we show the same in frontend as well.

Even though mail is sent from OM we need to receive a request for same towards Omnius to update the offer (which i done via pushoffestatus with sent status ) only then we will update in omnius.

and also please check alka’s comments which clearly says the status update is not done.

The expectation is incorrect.

The MTAN authentictication can only be triggered from the search screen and not from 360 view.

The MTAN authentication has a higher priority then the Flex authentication permission.

Regarding TechM Story OAF-445, the customer authentication button should be shown in the 360 view:

'Future topic wave7.1
FLEXIBLE_AUTHENTICATION + MTAN_AUTHENTICATION
{color:#00875a}{*}Agent see the *K{*}{*}unden authentication button in 360*{*}{color}
system consider MTAN_AUTHENTICATION'

 

Can you please check this story?

 

In parallel I will clarify with Anja Durben which is the expected behavior from her side.;;;","11/Jan/23 6:29 PM;nina.pickl@vodafone.com;Regarding Anja Durben it must work like described in the Story OAF-445:

 

Here is the answer from Anja:

 

This is definitely a bug.

VF understanding is: We must have 2 Layers / 2 Steps of Authentication:

 

*Step 1 - First Layer* : *at which time in flow authentication is triggered*

Soft Authentication, Hardauthentication, Flex Authentication

 

Hardauthentication – Authentication directly after the customer search (default)

Soft Authentication – no Authentication at all

Flex Authentication – In 360 view

 

*Step 2- Second Layer:* *which method of authentication must be used*

1) Customer keyword or alternative data (default)

2) 2of X

3) MTAN

4) Service Pin

 

It makes only sence to make a *prioritisation within* the 2 layers.

But not, to prioritise methode (Layer2) over at which time in the flow (Layer1) .

At which time (Layer1) has always higher priority than the methode (Layer2).

 

In the second layer, there can be a priorisation of which methode will be first, second, third if there are more options.

 

*See requirement for MTAN*

[OS-12205 [BUSINESS] As an agent, I want MTAN to replace the existing authentication method for dedicated scenarios, so that VF complies with legal requirements. - Vodafone Global Jira
 # *If* the agent is forced to authenticate the customer at all and if so, *at which point* in the sales flow this should happen is determined by already existing permissions and functionalities outside this epic (such as: hard authentication, soft authentication, no authentication, in future: flex authentication). The new permission for *MTAN Authentication should not change that but only determine how authentication is executed when it is required.* If the MTAN permission is assigned, it is supposed to be the default method. If it is not assigned, the fallback authentication (2 out of 6) should apply.

*See requirement for Flex Authentication:*

Kshitij Kumar Srivastava added a comment -
I also agree while implemention of CR632 {{MTAN_AUTHENTICATION}} was not in picture. so far it was never tested in CR632

also +Additional note+ in US OAF-445 was wrong for usecase MTAN + FLEX.

So according to authenticaton priority ruling
If Agent logged in Reatil and has both permission MTAN + FLEX then system first attempt MTAN authentication. 
In case MTAn fails system follow the fallback mean system will considder FLEX.

Note: with FLEX_AUTHENTICATION permisson if Agent lands to customer search page, then he can simply skip authentication on search page and continue in sales flow, when he lands to Customer 360 view page Agent must autheticate customer (mean ‘Kunden authentifizieren’ should appears over 360 page) 
And sytem should force Agent to autheticate customer before continue the sales flow.

So conclusion here 
This defect must be rejected. the expectation is incorrect.;;;","12/Jan/23 3:58 PM;nina.pickl@vodafone.com;Bug is assigned to me for tracking, due to clarification with VF and TechM for the MTAN+FLEXI case, if and when a new reqirenment for this case is needed.;;;","14/Apr/23 2:25 PM;ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com;we did not receive any new required so I think we should close it with the note Future release - what do you think [~nina.pickl@vodafone.com] ?;;;","17/Apr/23 4:46 PM;nina.pickl@vodafone.com;Hi [~ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com],

As discussed earlier that Omnius get the BEW text to show over UI which is from GetConfigurationData service resposne.

we saw in last call in resposne itself has text not in correct format. see the SS and fix need to done in OGW or backend system to send the correct text.

So this value is coming from FN backend system, then they should have send the correct values to omnius.

whatever vales received from that backend system will reflect in the Omnius front end.

 

Can you please assign to someone who is working on FN side backend system to resolve this issue.;;;","15/Aug/23 2:22 PM;ran.farjun1@vodafone.com;Hi,

Hello Marco,

Today , we have checked and observed that COM database is not showing Umlaute characters so Umlaute characters are not displayed at the BEW section on Voice Log page.

Please find the attached COM database and Voice log page screenshots

In my opinion it works as expected.

Application tries to find customer in db and via API. It is in try-catch blocks. 

When there is no exception then {{Keine Kunden gefunden}} section appears (in case no results).

When something went wrong, e.g. error on server side or client side, then error message appears. It means that some error occured but not no customers found.

This error is when app tries to communicate with OGW.

 Since this issue is not reproducible on ST env (with 9.16.0) and also local (with ver release/9.16.0 ) .
So checked the issue on ACC1 and I can reproducible on ACC1, and I also found this issue is only coming when SearchCustomer service is failing so that’s why it is not reproducible on local and ST. But this issue is not same with this ticket. So can you please raise fresh ticket mentioning this issue, as this issue which mentioned in the ticket is already resolved.

Note: this issue is not only reproducible on retails, but also present on telesales.

Bas Smeets added a comment -
 
 
A bit of background on this ticket.
 # This defect was raised to indicate the API performance has gone bad

 # It was established that the API test results heavily rely on the services response times, therefore the correlationId from the test has to be present in the serviceCallStatistics.log, we can then see the time it takes for the service to respond and correlate that with the test.

 # It was told by VF that the correlationId are not getting logged correctly. (current problem)

 

Next: I checked the fact that the correlationId is not being logged correctly when passing this in the request through jmeter. I am able to see exactly the correlationId’s that i am sending in the jmeter requests. I did the tests for search and 2 installedbase gigacombi requests. All are showing the corerlationId as being send in the request.

See screenshots and see adjusted for local jmeter script below.

Are we sure the correct logs are being retrieved? Since we are triggering this towards the DXL api server there it will connect to a ose instance (configured in .env field OSE_BOOTSTRAP) on the same machine.

 

Suggestion:

Setup a call to perform the test and retrieve the logs from DXL api server.

Hi All,

 

Thank you all for joining the call!!

 

Please find the final Action points below from our call today:

 
 # Initially correlation was not reflecting in log file but now correlation ID coming correctly in log file.
 # The scenario is not re-producible.
 # According to Bas Smeets, the slowness is either due to server or other system.

 

*Action Point:*

 

Testing team is again checking this defect and will share the latest observation.

 

Please feel free to add/update any points which we discussed in our call and is not covered in above MOM.

 

Thanks and Regards,

Currently we are still not sure how to check or compare the logs and which part giving us the issue and causing more response time than expected.
Also While triggering the scenario from the JMeter tool, it is not giving us the clear picture that which Backend systems causes us the delay in response time.
Regarding expected threshold of the response time Saurav is checking and we are waiting for his response.

So, it is still under discussion will update once it's finalized.;;;","04/Sep/23 5:26 PM;joachim.heiber@vodafone.com;Meetings with TechM and Production and Performance team happened.
Conclusion: 
 - API Team will concentrate on functional API tests
 - Performance Teams (VF, TechM, amdocs) are responsible and are verifying the performance related behaviour of OSF
 - If there is a request for single measurements of single requests, then LNP environment should be used. Response times on ACC environments are related to too many components like backend systems and other non OSF systems.

Therefore we decide to close this ticket and to not continue the investigation which is going around since december 2022. Performance tests and their investigations will be handled by performance team.;;;","11/Sep/23 11:47 AM;dipali.gakhare@vodafone.com;We send the mail to performance team, awaiting response if they want to continue with debugging or we can close the defect.;;;","11/Sep/23 4:54 PM;dipali.gakhare@vodafone.com;As per discussed with Joachime. This task has been assigned to the performance team. 

Hence for now after the update received from yash we are closing defect and for further checks and testing related to performance will be raised and handled by performance team.

The problem is that the wrong value is set in case of multistack orders. 

These are the values for *KundennummerArt* we need to set for the cable part towards OM in case it is unity.

UnityNW
UnityHE
UnityBW

 
||Region||OGW global_ID prefix // TargetSystem||OGW service address region||OM KundennummerArt||
|*Nordrhein-Westfalen*|*UN*|*UME-NRW*|*UnityNW*|
|Hessen|UH|UME-HSN|UnityHE|
|Baden-Württemberg|UB|UME-KBW|UnityBW|
|Vodafone Kabel Deutschland|KD|UNKNOWN, R01, R02, ... ,R09|VKD|

So if this is a bundle order with Cable and Mobile, currently it is set to VKD althought it is in unitymedia region. 
Maybe you can reproduce on your environment by creating a multistack order and check the logs 

I placed a new order with mobile and cable - Omnius order ID *917483*

System CRM value is correctly populated for the this order.

 

Anaylsis:

IPCC will sent an upper Case TransactionID to OMNIUS that will then call OGW service setPermission with an upper case transaction id in UniqueTransactionID.

Internally IPCC saves the transaction id lower case. This will lead to a lower case Transaction ID in the call to OGW service ArchiveFiles.

 

Functionality in OGW:
 # If ArchiveFiles service call comes first and SetPermission call comes later. In this case it will work fine as ogw has updated sql query in upper case.
 # If Set permission call comes first and ArchiveFiles call come later. In this case SetPermission flow will wait forever because transaction ids are not in same case.

 

FIX:

IPCC will always sent a lower case transaction_id with fix IPCCWDE-346.

Delivery to IPCC Test atarting 17.04.2023 will be available together with OSF Wave 8.0. 

 

OGW fix for SQl is now superfluous:

 Please find the below MOM for our call, took place today:

 1. [~rohan.kumbhar@vodafone.com] shared the issue:

Metadata file is not present in OGW VOICE_FILE_TO_PROCESS Table. -due to which CreateOptStatement is not getting triggered from OGW-->Anypoint/MoodDB

This is ACC2. I’m afraid I can’t help here: I don’t have access to any ACC logs. Moreover, please look at the attached files:

The screenshot shows some entries from Oct 21st/22nd, 2022, and the files in OS-25964.zip contain some logs from SIT from Dec 9th 2022.;;;","22/Feb/23 12:59 PM;ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com;[~vikash.saurav@vodafone.com]  someone from TechM Team should have access to ACC and should be able to reproduce issues and take the logs - if it is not Marcin then someone else from TechM team can take it. 

which kind of logs are needed? The confirmation that the setpermission call was successful came from Marcin, not from us. And also he mentioned the logs, so not sure which logs he was looking at. ;;;","22/Feb/23 1:39 PM;rahul.kumar17@vodafone.com;Hi All,

Thanks a lot.

ali;;;","15/Dec/22 8:01 PM;heike.eisenlohr1@vodafone.com;I think this bug was created when we did not receive any status updates due to some misconfiguration in the weborder DB. We fixed that configuration issue on Nov 8 (WeborderDBRelease 2190.2022.11.00.03). 
Since then it should work, also for manually approved orders since the weborder ID should be sufficient to get an order status.
Does the error still occur? If yes, do you have example orders? ;;;","16/Dec/22 2:06 PM;ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com;as per latest Discussion with Daniel, the customer ID is relevant to get the status. But for manual approved orders the customer id is not available in a short time. But if helpful we can create another order.... it would be great if issue is solved, because it is there since months.
At the same time we received order status completed for all orders which got auto approved.

 

[~singireddy.reddy@vodafone.com]  can you please create a new customer order on ACC1 for unitymedia which would force manual approval? You can place an order on an adress where the same IBAN is already used, and same customer name. Then it will come to manual approval.

Created 2 orders that went into manual.
We got them approved, one as a new customer order, one as an existing customer order. (this doesn't change the status, it remains open)
We got them closed (this changes the status)
The status closed was picked up by the UOTracker and is also visible from OSF (This means that we didn't find a bug)

Our current best guess from looking at the screenshots is that: in that case the order was only approved and not closed and as such the order status didn't change, so there was nothing to show in OSF.;;;","11/May/23 4:47 PM;ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com;[~singireddy.reddy@vodafone.com]  can you please run one test case again on ACC1 with manual approval?

Step 1: Complete the order (execute as new customer order) and check if it gets completed in frontend order manager

Please check as well if the customer id is transferred back to OSF

seems that OGW is sending tmp customer id becasue we didnt get in all setOrder status  requests customer id from Cable.
can you please check it with Cable?;;;","27/Oct/23 5:45 PM;ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com;I have the feeling we are running around in circles here.

Very long time ago I already mentioned that I assume we are not getting back the real customer ID and therefore we do not get the status completed

!image-2023-10-27-14-14-19-815.png!

 

1) in case the order is auto approved, we immediately get back the customer ID from unity backend, and it works fine

2) in case the order is manual approved after some time, somehow a second ""update"" is missing, which would return the customer ID 

But through all the discussions it was stated it should not be a problem in this area. I still feel that this gap is somewhere in this process.

Maybe we should have a call with all relevant parties -> OGW and VKD Gateway team ;;;","15/Nov/23 2:57 PM;devi.jampana@vodafone.com;Hi [~ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com] [~ran.farjun1@vodafone.com]

Yes for the Manual orders , success status is not reached in Telesales

Retail orders are working fine

As in defect steps it was mentioned retail, we tried placing orders with Retail

Changing the defect description to avoid further confusion

 

Regards

Srujana;;;","27/Nov/23 2:21 PM;ran.farjun1@vodafone.com;Hi,

so after the meeting today we agree that we need to check with Cable why OGW is not getting customer id in any of the set order status.
this is the reason why oneDMS call is failing.;;;","27/Nov/23 4:28 PM;ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com;The discussion in the beginning of this defect and my understanding all the time:

In case order is auto approved, customer ID is immediately given back to VKD Gateway
In Case order is NOT auto approved but later manually, there is no new call to get the customer ID -> thats why its not available

But in between it was mentioned that this is not the issue - as its working for retail, its strange that not working for Telesales.

Please note that OneDMS is handling Telesales Unity like VKD for Contract Summary Archiving. Not sure if relevant.

Action Point:

1. Elango Durairaj, Vodafone will place an Order and share with Nina Pickl, Vodafone.
2. Nina Pickl, Vodafone will discuss with Ari regarding Temp Id.;;;","30/Nov/23 11:01 AM;devi.jampana@vodafone.com;Hi ,

Outcome of yesterday call:

After investigation with Nina and Rohan , 

We got the information that for Auto approval orders we can see the customer number and Unified Order ID ,so success status is reflecting in OSF

But for Manual approval orders, Customer id is not available in logs and also Unified Order ID is missing and Action is getting skipped

Because of this issue , OGW is not sending the success status

We have to check on this issue with Unity BackEnd Developer

Will keep the updates posted

Hi All,
Thank you all for joining the call!!
 
Please find the final Action points below from our call today:
 
	1. [~nina.pickl@vodafone.com] and [~rohan.kumbhar@vodafone.com] have discussed with [~simon.auch@vodafone.com] regarding this defect.
	
Action Point:

	1. [~nina.pickl@vodafone.com] will check with [~ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com] and update the defect. If required then CR will be raised.


;;;","07/Dec/23 1:51 PM;nina.pickl@vodafone.com;Updates:

 

OGW needs the customer number in case Unity Manual Approval Orders in Telesales and Retails, which should be provided from VKD to OGW within the existing FulfillmentStarted Request.

 

The customer number is atm provided only for Auto Approval Orders, but missing for Manual Approval orders, therefore the document cannot be archived and the OGW processing remain in status pending (the VKD status is SUCCESS but the orders don't get Sucecss status in OSF Fronend):

An error was encountered while invoking ScanView-SaveDocument WS. Details [Error_Code: HTTPOutbound_0001, Error_Message: Received a fault from processing server for service '/ScanView-001/SaveDocument': An invalid number format or number value was encountered.

Note: Retail Manual Approval Orders don't have this issue because the call to oneDMS/Customernumber is not needed for the E2E flow. They get the Status Success.

 

As the customer number has not been sent for Manual Approval Order until now, a new PST change is required.

I will take the topic with me and check if we can request this change at the PST CAT train, Team Ash(Benjamin Sachse) or Nora.

 

The new requirement should contain following information:
 * no difference between retail and telesales from cable perspective
 * example set status messages received by OSF
 * fulfilment started from manual approval 
 * fulfilment started from automatic approval 


 * explanation on
 * what you clicked to create the manual approval order
 * how to approve the manual approval order

Will update here once it is clear how to process with the new change.;;;","18/Dec/23 3:04 PM;nina.pickl@vodafone.com;In Progress by PST Ash Team, corresponding Jira Ticket in PST Jira:

Previously when the order worked ,it was in TEST1B

After it was changed to TEST3B 

May be the changes were not there in TEST3B?(Just a doubt)

 

Regards

Srujana;;;","23/Jan/24 6:49 PM;simon.auch@vodafone.com;The test3b and test1b should both have sufficiently new versions deployed with the changes.

Some time ago you had a retest where a manual approval order was updated to status completed in OSF, could you also provide the logs for that order?

 ;;;","26/Jan/24 3:19 PM;ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com;I do not think that we can get these old logs anymore, not sure if we had restarts of servers in between.

Lets do one thing:

1) one retest on ACC1 test2b
2) one retest on ACC2 test3b

As far as I understood from Simon, solution should be present on both cable backends

[~elango.durairaj@vodafone.com]  [~devi.jampana@vodafone.com]  please do this test case beginning of next week, as in some days we switch to test4b and then we have to start again new ;;;","29/Jan/24 10:43 AM;devi.jampana@vodafone.com;Testing in ACC1 and ACC2

Elango D;;;","01/Feb/24 3:29 PM;nina.pickl@vodafone.com;Hi all,

1. For Omnius OrderID: 1038299 on ACC2/test3b -> the CUSTOMER_ID number was transferred to OGW:

[~simon.auch@vodafone.com] 

Elango performed the same flow on the both environments ACC1/test2b and ACC2/test3b- on ACC2/test3b worked fine, but not on ACC1/test2b.

Can you please check if the fix is available on test2b or what can be the reason otherwise?

 ;;;","01/Feb/24 4:26 PM;simon.auch@vodafone.com;So, the obvious difference between test3b (working) and test2b (not working) is that on test3b the status update is a `COMPLETED_SUCCESS` while on the test2b it is a `IN_PROGRESS_FULFILLMENT_STARTED`.

It can be seen that the unity order tracker on the test2b does not trigger any more updates for the order after the one with the status OPEN (for which we already have a customer ID as seen in the log).

I checked the test2b database contains the UME_ORDER_STATUS 'COMPLETED', which is correct, but apparently not written by the unity order tracker. Maybe there is a race condition between the unity order tracker and some other service that tries to write this field? This would also explain why it only happens sometimes.;;;","01/Feb/24 4:47 PM;nina.pickl@vodafone.com;[~elango.durairaj@vodafone.com]  Can you please check if the test2b order was successfully approved AND closed in Unity Backend?

 

Thanks [~simon.auch@vodafone.com] 

Was it not agreed/ implemented, that the customer number should be transferred in fullfilment started status?

That's why a change is needed that the customer number is transferred to OGW in the *fulfilment started status* message from VKD.;;;","01/Feb/24 5:19 PM;elango.durairaj@vodafone.com;[~nina.pickl@vodafone.com]  785791 ACC1 , test2b,  order was successfully completed in unity backend without any issue.

 * As expected we still see some updates that are created by an artifact that is not supposed to track unity orders:
{code:java}
Mar 15 07:14:58 vltn456 z3-test1b-app-jupiter FTM#2350.2024.03.00.00 42254613 INFO    core_1  core_1 43ea73qagerpjvtk430ft7imae de.kabeldeutschland.jupiter.core.vkd.VkdEventsProcessor - VkdGateway order status update success.

Response: OrderStatusResponse{httpCode=200, webOrderId=8057461, takenAction=SUCCESS - passed status to remote service} {code}
Which in turn still results in some updates send to OSF that are missing the customer id:
{code:json}
posted orderStatus {
  ""unifiedOrderId"" : ""1780729"",
  ""webOrderId"" : 8057461,
  ""orderStatus"" : ""IN_PROGRESS_FULFILLMENT_STARTED"",
  ""creationDate"" : ""2024-03-15T07:19:27.920"",
  ""statusInfos"" : [
    {
      ""statusType"" : ""EVENT_DETAIL"",
      ""system"" : ""cable"",
      ""eventCode"" : ""OTHER"",
      ""eventPresentationText"" : ""OTHER"",
      ""eventValue"" : ""OTHER""
    }
  ]
}
{code}

 * The update by the unity order tracker however did work and was also successfully published to OSF:
{code:json}
posted orderStatus {
  ""unifiedOrderId"" : ""1780729"",
  ""webOrderId"" : 8057461,
  ""orderStatus"" : ""COMPLETED_SUCCESS"",

      ""eventValue"" : ""543070901""
    }
  ]
}
{code}

My assumption right now is, that the ""lost"" updates before where due to the environment issues on VFW side and we actually only have the issue of updates that are send by another VKD system that are not supposed to be sent for VFW orders.;;;","27/Mar/24 4:08 PM;ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com;[~simon.auch@vodafone.com]  I am not really sure if I understand your comment correctly.

So you mean that we have to retry it once again because backend might had some problems?

The ""lost"" updates most likely were due to the environment issues on VFW side, or at least we cannot reproduce them anymore since they have been fixed.
The problematic updates sent to OSF by other cable systems that are missing the customer ID, should not happen anymore.

Edit: 
I'm not sure this is currently exactly the same issue as before as also successful orders cannot be found by the endpoint. Independent of this, however it is still an issue that can only be solved by unity.
There is currently no way I can further help with this topic as the issue is (according to my analysis) on unity side and I do not have access to it. Also notice that I already shared all unity contacts I have, to further progress with this topic please arrange a meeting with them. Feel free to invite me to the meeting.

It has to be clarified if we activate the channel ID in Production or if we leave it with WS Websales

*+Option 1:+*

- wir bleiben in Produktion auf channel ID WS

-> es ist zu prüfen ob es Unterschiede im Angebot von Web und Retail/ Telesales gibt (besonders bei Kampagne)
 -> wenn ein UPC für Web optional ist aber für OSF default ist das kein Problem – hauptsache es gibt das Produkt/ die Option für Web
 Risiko: Auf der ACC ist der Wert WS nicht mehr gesetzt, und es bleibt keine Zeit für ein Regressionstesting Neukunden GigaZuhause E2E / allerdings ist das wie gesagt schon seit Februar so

 

*+Option 2:+*

- wir stellen um auf RT/ CC

-> Arbeitsanweisung für Telesales: Das Sicherheitspaket +darf nicht abgewählt werden+ in OSF. Wenn jemand bei WW Line die Option nicht möchte, muss ein anderer Eingangskanal gewählt werden als OSF

-> Retail darf nicht gelauncht werden bevor das Problem mit dem doppelt gebuchten UPC behoben ist 
 Risiko: Wenn das Sicherheitspaket abgewählt wird ist die Contract Summary nicht identisch mit der Auftragsbestätigung

 

Generell brauchen wir eine Lösung für die Thematik und vermutlich dafür noch mal Entwicklung, aber die Entscheidung ist jetzt erstmal auf Basis GigaZuhause zu treffen.;;;","07/Nov/22 1:18 PM;singireddy.reddy@vodafone.com;Hi [~ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com]

Expected : Tariff list should not be empty. KUD product should be selectable but then error message should be displayed as it is not allowed to book KIP and KUD on unitymedia adress in same order

 

Steps to recreate :
 # Take an unitymedia address in Telesales 
 # Search the address.
 # Move to package configurator and select any KIP product.
 # Move to package configurator and check for the KUD products.

So with this defect the expected result should be 

1) KUD products should be listed after we have selected KIP Unitymedia 

2) After selection KUD product error message should be shown because it is not allowed to mix KIP Unity and KUD products in one order

3) Error message should state clearly why it is not possible to mix the products in one order (improvement, taken from discussion of OS-22095)

this is works as designed. At a Unitymedia address you currently cannot book KIP/TV in combination with KUD.

Cable and Unitymedia still have separated backends.
 * You need a Unitymedia customer for booking KIP/TV at an Unitymedia address.
 * You need a Cable customer for booking KUD (no matter the address).

Both cannot be handled together as part of the same order.;;;","20/Dec/22 7:49 PM;ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com; Hi Moritz, we know that this is not allowed. but the implementation was different in the past.

Expected is - tariff list is filled, we select a tariff and then error message is displayed ( KUD product should be selectable but then error message should be displayed)

But instead now tariff list is empty.

1 We are not getting error message anymore but in product configuration KUD products are empty (this is before shopping card already)---> {color:#FF0000}OS-25212{color}

Its not about one place, we have to consider generic behaviour for naming convension.

Divya Kumbla commented as-

@natasa As per the CR611 the Firmenname Zusatz is expected to be sent in payer contact in submit order(SAML POST Binding in progress...)and seeing the logs attached it is being sent correctly.
 !screenshot-1.png|thumbnail! 
 !screenshot-2.png|thumbnail! 

As far as accountownername in billingaccountlist is concerned ,according to OS-9067,they mentioned in case of different person we need to concatenate firstname and lastname but there is no requirement in CR611 for concatenating the companyname1 and companyname2 if the account holder is different firm.

Bhavesh Renpara added a come - 

This is not valid defect, we never sends the district in check service availability request even not in validate address request, most important parameter to send in ServiceAvilibility request after validate address is addressId which is uniq id of address and against that backend finds the availability results. So there is no chance due to missing district backend can give wrong availability result. You can verify same with VKD backend which returns availability results.

Please check and confirm ;;;","23/Sep/22 10:32 AM;singireddy.reddy@vodafone.com;Hi [~thomas.schneider1@vodafone.com] ,

In omnius UI There is no interface to add districts as input. Therefore, we can only send districts if we receive this in the validate address response, so please share the following logs.
 # validate address request and response.

 # serviceability request and response.

It would be great if you could confirm with the vodafone BA team if this is really needed or if it is just something that has been observed during testing.;;;","06/Feb/23 9:04 PM;singireddy.reddy@vodafone.com;Hi [~vikash.saurav@vodafone.com] ,

we have to make sure, that the given payer is printed on the SEPA mandate. Whatever payer it is - company or private customer. And if payer is identical to billing adress contact or not.

Do not mix up bill owner and Payer:

I have enclosed a very detailled test step description (word document, from today) from OM colleage (was done on ACC1, but its also issue on ACC2)

You have to compare to interface description from OM, as there the naming might be different.

 * Import of a category will erase/replace all IDs (example: Mobile or Fixed Net/DSL or Cable)
 * Those old IDs are still being used by other categories, also new tariffs have no counterpart in for exmple: bundles  
 * Old IDs are still being referenced in dependent categories (example: Bundles broken because of old IDs after Mobile only partial import)

*Goal*
 * Please resolve the ""missing ID""  issue with least impact to import duration.

*Some options/Ideas*
 * *Synchronization of IDs:* The number of categories being imported stay the same but their IDs are being updated and syncronized with all interdependant categories.
 * *Synchronization of Import:* If absolutely necessary import of categories due to hash change might need to trigger import of other categories, too (_Example:_ Mobile category import triggers Bundle category import). This is the worst solution, as it impacts runtime.

Retest failed.

Regards,

Harsha;;;","17/May/23 3:31 PM;rohan.kumbhar@vodafone.com;Seems we have some issue regarding the IPCC flow where issue seems to be in OGW—

I did some investigation and found the below analysis:-

Flow for IPCC :-

Telesales Dialer Flows

Step 1. SetPermission will be triggered from Omnius to OGW

Step 2. based on the unique Transaction id --anycaller will send the Voicefiles to OGW --ArchiveFiles API-- Metadata and Voicefiles

Step 3: OGW will call UM_SET_PERMISSION_CALLBACK and then CreateOptStatement is called to Anypoint

 

OGW is triggering the CreateOptStatement call but after parsing seems some exception as: <2023-05-13 06:03:17,145> <ERROR> <JESI> [Tid:ActiveMQSessionTask-1422428]:Exception @[NodeId=4.1.3.1.1.1;Element=TRY@vfde/permission/setPermission/um/vfde_um_set_permission_handler_V3.xml]Error=Code=JESIERR-1;Description=java.io.FileNotFoundException:/opt/SP/WEB_DATA/OPT/VoiceFilesToProcess/VBE_GEN_VBE01c00350a037a5c6_20230512091250.mp3 (No such file or directory)
