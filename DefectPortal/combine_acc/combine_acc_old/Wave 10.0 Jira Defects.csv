We've encountered with our Mobile Private New Activation orders that include more than two packages. It seems these orders are getting stuck at the Credit Evaluation step in KIAS. As discussed and confirmed by the KIAS Test Team, the current reference data indicates that KIAS supports a maximum of two packages activation for Individual (Private) customer types.
 
In the past, with previous OSF releases, the activation process worked smoothly for more than four packages for Private customers. In the current release, we also have test cases that include more than two packages. Could you please check and confirm what the expected behavior should be in this scenario?

GLS discontinued its GLSIDENT service some time ago (months ago). For security reasons, we didn't immediately deactivate it in Prod, but instead made it ""unselectable"" via PriceRange adjustments. It was finally deactivated now (in Prod and Test). Unfortunately, the PriceRange in Test hadn't been adjusted at the time, so since yesterday, the old service for items up to €600 hasn't been available, only new services. We've now corrected the PriceRange in Test as well, and an old service is being returned via the GASO.;;;",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

hi [~elango.durairaj@vodafone.com] 
When we trigger any DXL service ,the Oauth is called to get a bearer token and once received it will be stored in OSF redis cache such that if the same DXL call triggered again the token is taken from cache( if its available) instead of calling the Oauth again.

Please verify once by clearing cache;;;","25/Sep/25 12:20 PM;elango.durairaj@vodafone.com;Retest InProgress, already tested , but still same issue, will try one more order.;;;","25/Sep/25 4:37 PM;ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com;[~elango.durairaj@vodafone.com]  did you clear the caches as mentioned from TechM?

The error is received from DXL and it says its already verified.From OSF perspective whatever response we receive from DXL the same is shown .please check with DXL team.

As i see the message says its already verified hence you can proceed.

eSIMHW for eSIM
pSIMHW for pSIM

However, in PCAT, the SIM Compatibility field was left blank/null, and the implementation failed to handle this edge case.

The code did not include logic to handle cases where SIM_COMPATIBILITY is blank or null. The current logic only handles explicitly defined values (eSIM, pSIM, both) and skips validation for empty value.;;;",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Hi Maheedhar,

 

When system trigger the ValidateAddress service request with value * mean a wildcard input to backend to result back to Omnius with possible Address list value response. 
* value is not acceptable value as a part of ValidateAddress response xml. ref interface definition.

This issue seems to be related to the PST bug: [[PSTBUG-3509] PAPI | OSF | VKD,VFW | All orders are failing with Delivery & Billing address error message - DE Jira|https://de.jira.agile.vodafone.com/browse/PSTBUG-3509]

Answer from developer:

Hello,
The issue is in IBP (IRIS) when it contacts AdsFacade to validate the sent addresses. The exact field causing the issue is houseNumberAddition. When the field is omitted in the request, AdsFacade returns an asterisk in the candidate addresses. When the address is compared with the candidate address returned from AdsFacade, the validation fails (becasue null != '*'). 
A workaround can be applied in IRIS to ignore asterisks in both the address and the candidate address when comparing them as it's already a wildcard.

Todays meeting with TechM and ACC-Team revealed that this issue is NO bug.
it is based more or less on a misunderstanding about the different PCAT setups for Telesales and Retail scenarios.

1. The purpose of the affected PCAT Compatibility Rule is to force an agent/user belonging to a Retail sales channel to select an sku from the category of retail blister(i.e. a SIM card item or eSIM cardboard card physically available in the shop).

2. During test execution, a clear distinction must be made between the agent’s affiliation with a particular sales channel and the login process on the respective Telesales or Retail websites.

3. Unfortunately the above mentioned rule cannot be restricted to the webite ""Retail"". Instead it evaluates the agent’s affiliation with a particular sales channel.

4. The current Prepaid product configuration in PCAT for Telesales restricts tariff selection to the predefined set of Telesales-specific SKUs (formatted as 'Kso' + <KIAS-TO-code>). Upon selection, a corresponding SIM/blister/item is automatically added to the shopping cart in a one-to-one relationship. Manual selection of alternative products or tariffs by the user is not permitted in this flow. After checkout, the order is transmitted to SAP, which initiates the dispatch of a pre-activated SIM card to the customer via mail.
 
5. The updated Prepaid product setup in PCAT for Retail enables the selection of both a blister item and a tariff from the available set of Retail tariffs (SKUs formatted as 'K' + <KIAS-TO-code>). Typically, the user first selects a blister item, after which a default tariff —usually the one printed on the packaging and defined in the KIAS table PREPAID_PACKAGE for the selected item_id— is automatically pre-selected. The user then has the option to deselect and change this default tariff and choose an alternative from the list of available tariffs, as defined in the KIAS table ACTIVATION_SETTINGS for the selected item_id. Upon checkout, the retail agent hands the blister/SIM to the customer, and the order is transmitted to the KIAS backend for subscriber activation. Especially in this scenario, it is important to use PCAT rules to force the user to select a blister and a tariff before checkout. 

-> Telesales user/sales id should belong to a Telesales channel (not the website) and a blister item is added automatically to the shopping cart after tariff selection.
Retail user/sales id should belong to a Retail channel (Filiale, Fachhandel, Partneragentur) and a tariff is preselected after blister selection.Manual choice of a blister is mandatory.

-> Tickets OS-77100, OS-76802, OS-76950 should be rejected and cancelled.;;;",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i can see from agent status table info both these agents have last logged in before couple of months the season we are getting this msg access blocked is due to threshold value from BO you can verify from acc BO

!image-2025-09-02-14-58-27-873.png!

 

in actual we should get this msg 

!image-2025-09-02-15-03-45-614.png!

I suspect the reason is in agent table reasonsuspensionid value is Array

need to find out why this is setting to array please help to get below data:

As discussed with Shrikrishna, we currently do not have the required access for this agent configuration. We have therefore requested with the IXc team (Sneha) to assist with the necessary details.

Regarding the issue, we are facing challenges with users that were created earlier (OLD) either via NGUM or manually.;;;","03/Sep/25 12:39 PM;ashutosh.chavan@vodafone.com;Hello [~bharath.krishnamurthy@vodafone.com] 

As requested, Sneha has provided the BO System Configuration details for analysis. Following this, Shrikrushna identified that the access block was caused by the threshold value set to 42 days.
To resolve the issue, we already attempted to unblock the user from the back office by performing actions such as unlocking the account and resetting the password. However, the issue remains unresolved.
Shrikrushna needs to investigate further to determine how we can successfully unblock these user accounts.;;;","12/Sep/25 10:38 AM;bharath.krishnamurthy@vodafone.com;[~ashutosh.chavan@vodafone.com] [~yogesh.borade1@vodafone.com]

We have compared with previous order before deployment, and in that this tag was not going. After deployment this tag is getting populated for Non-DF orders. This is impacting Non-DF mobile order BE processing.

 

Steps to reproduce:
 # Login to Omnius

 # Submit the order

Most probably this is not reflected in the used PCAT from 10.06..

the SOC table in KIAS-env VOL17 must be copied as a local table to change the SOC.SALE_EXP_DATE.

I suppose the data is coming from the ref master which is usually production (or production-like).;;;","21/Aug/25 5:30 PM;ajay.yashwantbhavar@vodafone.com;Except below product combinations, other combination will work.

Disabling/Enabling the VIP did not make a difference.

As per the current implementation logic, the contract subdivision value within the catalog package is only set during the configurator product loading process.
In certain flows, particularly when the user proceeds directly to checkout without loading the Cable TV package in the configurator, the contract subdivision value is not set in the associated table. As a result, the system misclassifies the package under the Cable instead of the intended UME.

Hi, 

As discussed in the call we observed that the response received from cable is different from what we used to get previously and also mentioned in the SS 1563870_image-2025-07-09-17-57-15-400.png. The mandatory fields ""type"" and ""supportedSmartcards"" are missing in the response which is why OGW is returning an error. Can you please check with Cable team if something was changed from their side. attaching the current response received from Cable:

At this point in time it is not clear, if the customer will pick the hardware or not. The EVT_040 with location type VF_STORE therefore has to be “ignored”. Instead OSF has to wait for the following final status “VORAS_FINAL_SUCCESS_SHIP_TO_STORE_HANDOUT” which is sent from VORAS after final sale to the customer. This process was implemented with project eSim Push and also needs to be used for device financing. The loan activation may only be triggered, when the final sale was done in VORAS.

Steps to re-produce:
1. Login to telesales channel
2. Configure mobile package with DF tariff and H/W
3. fill all customer details
4. select shiptostore
5. check out
6. submit order

{*}Actual Result{*}: OGW is calling SIM Swap request for S2S order without waiting for final status “VORAS_FINAL_SUCCESS_SHIP_TO_STORE_HANDOUT” which is sent from VORAS after final sale to the customer in Telesales channel.

{*}Expected result{*}: Status InProgress-HWFulfilmentReady with VF_STORE should be ignored in OGW.

1.  In this case *(SimCard=E, ActivtyType=New),* OGW calls RequestSimSwap after the subscriber is activated in KIAS, this behavior aligns with the design and is functioning as expected.

2. Upon receiving *EVT_040* with *SAPLocationType = VFSTORE,* OGW appropriately ignored it and awaited the *VORAS_FINAL_SUCCESS_SHIP_TO_STORE_HANDOUT* event to proceed with loanActivation and subsequently mark the orderLine as completed.

However instead of VORAS_FINAL_SUCCESS_SHIP_TO_STORE_HANDOUT, OGW received an addition *EVT_040* for the same orderLine {*}without SAPLocationType as VFSTORE{*}, which is incorrect and also the reason for processing this status, as OGW neither received the SAPLocationType nor the EID. Attaching both the setOrderStatus EVT_040 for your reference.

Hi @Sneha Wayal, Vodafone,

Hi Sneha/Gokul,


According to our investigations though the call, if the value VF_STORE is present in the SAP Status file then we transfer it to OGW. If it is not present then we also do not proceed with it. Thus, the RCA is either the value was not initially present in the SAP file or was present twice: with and without value.;;;","22/Sep/25 8:01 PM;atharva.paskanthi@vodafone.com;Reopening to update correct Resolution;;;",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Srujana;;;","08/Aug/25 5:46 PM;devi.jampana@vodafone.com;Comment from Tobias:

When a customer is opened in OSF and has inventory devices, these must be send to BLES for the rule execution. There was currently a refactoring on how these are send from VkdGateway. The new interface is described here:
[https://de.confluence.agile.vodafone.com/spaces/PORTALS/pages/644318331/Interface+between+BLES+and+VKD+Gateway+IBP]

BLES expects that the $deviceType in the new device format is 'UNIVERSAL' and the deviceSpecifications are delivered in the $supportedFeatures array.
However, the $deviceType field is still send in the old format (""CABLEMODEM"") while the $supportedFeatures array already contains the new format – as a result, BLES tries to interpret the new features in the old way, leading to wrong results:
{quote}""installedBaseServiceLines"": [

""supportedFeatures"":

,
""legacyLocation"": ""IN1"",

}
]
},
{quote}
The result is that we probably try to swap modems for customer who would not actually need modems to be swapped – or rather before that, the orders fail because IBP and OSF disagree on what should happen and a Sky Force ticket is created.

but in PST Bug there is some more comment:

This bug is *not* {*}only UM{*}, since this week, it also affects {*}VKD{*}:
Regression run on 6th of August: kip tariffchanges were succussfully
Regression run on 11th of August: kip tariffchanges are failing with skytickets

When comparing the results, it is conspicuous, although the customer has a appropriate device in its inventory, a hardwarecode for Wlan Kabelmodem is added (W4B is always there)
Even if the customer has a homebox in inventory, it adds a W4B. Which doesn't make sense. 

Example osf order: 1003999

Hello Sneha,

 

We have already reported the Credit Check callback issue to the OCCS team regarding the “external_credit_class” parameter value. I have also sent them a reminder to expedite the update. Please find the attached email for your reference.

 

I'll keep you posted as soon as we receive a response from the OCCS team.;;;","07/Aug/25 5:05 PM;sneha.wayal1@vodafone.com;Hello Sneha,

 

Unfortunately, we still haven't received a response from the OCCS team.

In the meantime, as per Joerg's suggestion, we've disabled the Credit Check for the OPT-VOL16 Environment to prevent any impact on the OSF Activation flows. You can go ahead and proceed with your tests now.

 

Please let us know if you encounter any other issues. Just a heads up, the Credit Checks will be re-enabled once we hear back from the OCCS team.

I can see one pipeline is missing before the VFStore value from SAP. As a result, Omnius is taking VFStore as the EID Number since it's present in the EID Number place. Due to this issue, Omnius is sending the Attribute value VFStore in the Attribute code EID in “InProgress-HWFulfilmentReady” SetOrderStatus to OGW. Therefore, OGW is not waiting for the final status from VORAS and completing the flow.

The current implementation in OGW has been in place since day one and no changes were requested so far. Can we check the logs from sanity runs of previous releases to confirm this behavior, we can then discuss the next steps accordingly.

Thanks 

 ;;;","11/Aug/25 4:06 PM;alka.kshirsagar2@vodafone.com;Hi [~affan.baragazi@vodafone.com] we have checked and found that 

<value>0174{*}7{*}_{*}289873{*}</value>

in this case MSISDN value is 7289873 and city code is 0174

'7' is digit from MSISDN, why its getting merged in NDC value?

And also MSISDN value is six digit no. instead of 7 digit

it should be: *174_7289873* as per PARES, can you please check once again

We observed in DeviceFinacing tariff with 12, 24 and 36 months DF duration, the monthly totals on mobile (tariff) bill shows two lines, although the total charge is not different.

order id: 994443

As there is no need for showing the customer, that he must pay different prices for the VF service during his contract period, there is also no need to show this part  “Monat 1 - XX”  and   “ab Monat  [XX+1])
Exactly as it is today in production!

Solution/Defect hint: 
As expect that somehow the devicefinancing duration of the  (mobile Mixmatch File:  DeviceFinancingDuration parameter)  is handed overfrom Omnius  to OGW ->  OM  ->  most likely an Omnius defect/design gap

The CR we created a few weeks ago for correcting the mobile contract in case of device financing:
[OS-73799] BUSINESS: CR948: As a sales agent I want the mobile contract to be correct in case of DF tariffs - defect4 - Vodafone Global Jira

The technical stories are linked in this Business story


{*}Steps to reproduce{*}:
1. Loging to retail / telesales channel
2. Configure mobile package with DF tariff and H/W
3. Select Ship to store as delivery method
4. Generate DF contract document
5. Submit the order

{*}Actual Result{*}: DeviceFinacing tariff with 12, 24 and 36 months DF duration, the monthly totals on mobile (tariff) bill shows two lines, although the total charge is not different

 !screenshot-2.png|thumbnail! 

{*}Expected Result{*}: DeviceFinacing tariff with 12 months DF duration, the monthly totals on mobile (tariff) bill should show single line

This is in-line with the logic set in OS-74013, OS-73962 and OS-73963.

This is split excluding Device Details. This was the agreed JSON format with OGW.

The 1-24 months is without Device SKU details and 25 month onwards only Tariff value;;;","28/Jul/25 6:52 PM;nasir.sayyad@vodafone.com;Hello

Below is reply from Rob

I guess Shruti has a point, but I don’t get it.
From  “high level” perspective the mistake is clear to me:
As usual:  if there is only one price, that the customer must pay over the complete contract period  (which is endless for mobile tariffs) , then there is only one total line to be printed  (as we hae done always)
But,  if the decisions, that were made in  the solution design lead to another outcome ( which is the part, that I don’t understand:  requirement was always and still is clear:  in case of device financing NO hardware related stuff to be put on the mobile contract) WHY do we have two lines in the totals, although the total costs do not change?

We will schedule a call for the same;;;","29/Jul/25 2:17 PM;atharva.paskanthi@vodafone.com;Checked with Nasir, Discussion is ongoing between Rob and Shruti, will schedule a call later for this if required;;;","30/Jul/25 4:34 PM;nasir.sayyad@vodafone.com;Hello,

We had a meeting with Rob, Shruti and Gaurab and below is the outcome of meeting

Hi,

See attached document we created during the call  for defining the algorithm how to remove duplicate line in the Mobile contract in case of device financing

Assumption;  today in  production these duplicate lines do not happen for subsidized tariffs/hardware  and this is only caused by the device financing SKU in the submitOrder

Shruti has stated, that adding this additional logic to the already very complex device financing submitOrder logic might have a severe impact on the performance.

Todo TechM:  align with development team, if the solution as defined in this call is feasible  (and if yes: commicate an expected delivery date)

Hi Srujana,

 The Customer ID number is populated based on SubmitOrder Response (GenerateContract Mode). In this use case the CustomerId and BANPartyID are not seen in the response hence is not shown in the Order Manager too.;;;","04/Aug/25 12:42 PM;joerg.trierweiler1@vodafone.com;Testorder 999859 in ACC1 fits = shows the exact symptom:
 # Detail view of order shows the response of the Cablemaster order numbers ""Referenz ID"" and ""Auftragsnummer""

 # IAV shows that besides those the customer# would also be available

Before yesterday deployment IBAN of existing customer was not visible in overview page while performing X-Sell.

But when there are 3 or more than 3 package then Iban is not visible for 3rd package in overview page.

Hi [Hamza Balci, Vodafone (External)|https://de.jira.agile.vodafone.com/secure/ViewProfile.jspa?name=hamza.balci1%40vodafone.com]

Laut omogw.xsd sollte unter einem PackageConfiguration Knoten mindestens ein Knoten „CommercialProducts“ vorhanden sein.

!image-2025-07-23-20-45-15-966.png!

Sobald mindestens ein Knoten „CommercialProducts“ hinzugefügt wurde, treten keine Probleme bei der Verarbeitung auf (siehe Anhang).

*Wir haben auch die Testdaten überprüft, die dem Produktionsvorfall INC000094827316 beigefügt waren. Dort besteht das gleiche Problem.*

*Da es sich um ein Problem mit den Eingabedaten handelt, sollte im Eingabesystem geprüft werden, warum das System diese Informationen in diesem Szenario nicht an OM weiterleitet.*

FYI: die zweite PackageConfiguration  Knoten kann entfernt werden. Es funktioniert ebenfalls einwandfrei, sofern die erste PackageConfiguration  für TV die aktuellen Details nach der Änderung enthält.

OM is saying that the cause of the issue is that the ""CommercialProducts"" node is missing in the second ""PackageConfiguration"" of type TV.

 ;;;","25/Jul/25 5:37 PM;affan.baragazi@vodafone.com;Hi [~natasa.dimovic1@vodafone.com] ,

OGW includes *CommercialProducts* in a package only when the *LineActivityType* in the *CommercialDetails* (received in the SubmitOrder request from Omnius) is not ""{*}REFUSE{*}"" or ""{*}DROP{*}"", and the *ScopeList* contains a Scope with the value ""{*}Contract{*}"".

For the second package, such CommercialDetails are missing, which is why OGW does not add any CommercialProducts to it.

PFB for reference:

Hi [~natasa.dimovic1@vodafone.com] 

We did further analysis and got to know that RetrieveDocument Service we called when we clicked the Drucken (Second button on flow) there is some error response received. Due to which the document is not opened.

Which means on OSE there is no issue we need to check with OGW on why we have the problematic response on this flow.

Kindly reject and assign to OGW

The error mentioned in the below comment is valid. OGW is returning it because we haven't yet received a callback from OM for that specific document. This can be confirmed by checking the status in the OGW_SEND_DOCUMENT_TRANSACTIONS table, which currently shows ""Sent to OM"". Once the callback is received, OGW will update the status to ""Success"" and Omnius will be able to fetch that document.;;;","21/Aug/25 5:36 PM;natasa.dimovic1@vodafone.com;Hi [~affan.baragazi@vodafone.com] so does it mean it is an OM issue?

As mentioned earlier as well, OGW includes *CommercialProducts* in a package only when the *LineActivityType* in the *CommercialDetails* (received in the SubmitOrder request from Omnius) is not ""{*}REFUSE{*}"" or ""{*}DROP{*}"", and the *ScopeList* contains a Scope with the value ""{*}Contract{*}"".

For the second package with SkuID {*}SN3{*}, these conditions still appear to be unmet, which is why OGW does not add the CommercialProducts to it.

 ;;;","10/Jul/25 2:53 PM;ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com;Feedback from Portal: It seems that, due to some issues, test1b did not pick up the correct version from ci2b, which likely caused the problem.

 ;;;","10/Jul/25 7:07 PM;ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com;Feedback from portal side:


We (Team Spice) had a change to the logic in MinervaAdapter and how it retrieves the config value for the Minerva URL.

Originally, there was one config value ""MinervaClient.uri"". We split this into ""anypoint.baseUri"" and ""minervaClient.path""

The currently deployed  new versions of MinervaAdapter already use the baseUri and the path, instead of the uri
 # action: switch the config value for test1b in the WMC and restart MinervaAdapter -> retest failed

*Note:* While Entering invalid Serial number We are getting  Technical Error as below-

But We are not Sure as this is also expected for Invalid Case as We are not tested this case yet. This error message should be shown if the service is failing, see OTF-929 OMNIUS_CONF_As an Agent, I want to see a meaningful message in case the service GetTvEquipmentFeatures is failed due to technical failure so that I will be aware about the unusual behaviour of the UI and try later. - Vodafone Global Jira. But which error message should be shown, if an invalid serial number is entered?

I had aligned with [akash.ubbu@vodafone.com|mailto:akash.ubbu@vodafone.com] regarding this issue and we together checked in ACC1 instance. The issue is happening because of empty records are inserted in the manage agent / agent database table due to that the agent information's are not populating in UI level. So the issue is not with the CR899 implementation, its only because of agent data's are empty in the database table.

Actual issue : When ordering cable, mobile and TV tariffs together and using the OSF bundle service to get bundles and validate the selection, the TV tariff is dropped by the bundle service

Test scenario: 

 * Create a new customer order at Adolf-Mathes-Weg 51, 80999 München

 * Select:

      * Vodafone GigaTV Sound Cable inkl. Netflix

      * GigaZuhause BV 1000/50 Kabel, 1.-12. Monat 19,99 €

      * GigaMobile M

 * call OSF Bundle service at ACC1 (OSFInstalledBase v3, bundle eligibily endpoint - [https://dxl.preprod.api.vodafone.de/osfinstalledbase/v3/bundle/eligibility?originator=mhv|https://eur03.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fdxl.preprod.api.vodafone.de%2Fosfinstalledbase%2Fv3%2Fbundle%2Feligibility%3Foriginator%3Dmhv&data=05%7C02%7CAriadne.Thun1%40vodafone.com%7Cc87ec75ae62342e1968508ddbd688812%7C68283f3b84874c86adb3a5228f18b893%7C0%7C0%7C638874978844732164%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJFbXB0eU1hcGkiOnRydWUsIlYiOiIwLjAuMDAwMCIsIlAiOiJXaW4zMiIsIkFOIjoiTWFpbCIsIldUIjoyfQ%3D%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&sdata=u13zyNsKCQIEe0per5A5HTXhM80TrNk%2BmOmvPKIZNHM%3D&reserved=0])

On every new customer order for VFW footprint the value entered in OSF Gui company name field for serviceaddress ist correctly added in all four SourceContact fields <CompanyName>.

On an existing customer the same field is just pre-filled by data loaded from backend.

Why is <ContactRole>PC not also automatically pre-populated with that value - as all other SourceContactIDs are?",,alka.kshirsagar2@vodafone.com,ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com,atharva.paskanthi@vodafone.com,denka.ainsworth@vodafone.com,gaurav.lanjewar1@vodafone.com,joerg.trierweiler1@vodafone.com,krishnkumar.satpute@vodafone.com,matthias.breuer1@vodafone.com,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"07/Aug/25 3:04 PM;joerg.trierweiler1@vodafone.com;B2B_SoHo_testorder3_OrderManager_Details.png;https://jira.sp.vodafone.com/secure/attachment/1583053/B2B_SoHo_testorder3_OrderManager_Details.png","07/Aug/25 3:03 PM;joerg.trierweiler1@vodafone.com;B2B_SoHo_testorder3_PersonalData.png;https://jira.sp.vodafone.com/secure/attachment/1583052/B2B_SoHo_testorder3_PersonalData.png","07/Aug/25 3:04 PM;joerg.trierweiler1@vodafone.com;B2B_SoHo_testorder3_Workorder_Cablemaster.png;https://jira.sp.vodafone.com/secure/attachment/1583054/B2B_SoHo_testorder3_Workorder_Cablemaster.png","07/Aug/25 1:05 PM;joerg.trierweiler1@vodafone.com;Customer_data_OSF_prefilled-companyname.png;https://jira.sp.vodafone.com/secure/attachment/1582838/Customer_data_OSF_prefilled-companyname.png","11/Jul/25 1:41 PM;atharva.paskanthi@vodafone.com;Fullfillment VKD.xml;https://jira.sp.vodafone.com/secure/attachment/1565244/Fullfillment+VKD.xml","11/Jul/25 1:41 PM;atharva.paskanthi@vodafone.com;GenerateContract VKD.xml;https://jira.sp.vodafone.com/secure/attachment/1565245/GenerateContract+VKD.xml","10/Jul/25 6:28 PM;atharva.paskanthi@vodafone.com;OS-74873 Logs.zip;https://jira.sp.vodafone.com/secure/attachment/1564879/OS-74873+Logs.zip","07/Aug/25 1:07 PM;joerg.trierweiler1@vodafone.com;Order_details_Order-Manager_sucessful_processing.png;https://jira.sp.vodafone.com/secure/attachment/1582840/Order_details_Order-Manager_sucessful_processing.png","07/Aug/25 1:07 PM;joerg.trierweiler1@vodafone.com;Order_in_Cablemaster.png;https://jira.sp.vodafone.com/secure/attachment/1582841/Order_in_Cablemaster.png","04/Jul/25 8:14 PM;joerg.trierweiler1@vodafone.com;PRocess order Request Fullfilment.xml;https://jira.sp.vodafone.com/secure/attachment/1560700/PRocess+order+Request+Fullfilment.xml","04/Jul/25 8:13 PM;joerg.trierweiler1@vodafone.com;Skyforce error_COMPANY_NAME.png;https://jira.sp.vodafone.com/secure/attachment/1560697/Skyforce+error_COMPANY_NAME.png","04/Jul/25 8:13 PM;joerg.trierweiler1@vodafone.com;Skyforce error_COMPANY_NAME_gui-submitOrder-sky.png;https://jira.sp.vodafone.com/secure/attachment/1560698/Skyforce+error_COMPANY_NAME_gui-submitOrder-sky.png","04/Jul/25 8:14 PM;joerg.trierweiler1@vodafone.com;Submitorder Request Fullfilment.xml;https://jira.sp.vodafone.com/secure/attachment/1560699/Submitorder+Request+Fullfilment.xml",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Yes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,All VFW Soho customers will fail in E2E Flow and order is not reaching backend,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,ACC1,,,,OS-68705,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"We have delivered full build   towards ACC1/PROD   for W10.0.1

At this point in time it is not clear, if the customer will pick the hardware or not. The EVT_040 with location type VF_STORE therefore has to be “ignored”. Instead OSF has to wait for the following final status “VORAS_FINAL_SUCCESS_SHIP_TO_STORE_HANDOUT” which is sent from VORAS after final sale to the customer. This process was implemented with project eSim Push and also needs to be used for device financing. The loan activation may only be triggered, when the final sale was done in VORAS.

Steps to re-produce:
1. Logging to telesales/retail channel
2. Configure mobile package with DF tariff and H/W
3. fill all customer details
4. select shiptostore
5. check out
6. submit order

{*}Expected result{*}: GW should complet S2S order after final status “VORAS_FINAL_SUCCESS_SHIP_TO_STORE_HANDOUT” which is sent from VORAS after final sale to the customer.

Hi Nihal,
 
Address auto suggest is from the Google API service and Suggestion results have not control over OSE application, instead OSE Will fill the address details received from the API response. Looks problematic zip example 81927 don't have complete address details from API response.

Not OSE s/w issue.

 

Thanks;;;","17/Jul/25 12:04 PM;ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com;[~bharath.krishnamurthy@vodafone.com]  [~vikash.saurav@vodafone.com]  did anyone check the comment from Ajay?

Hi Maheedhar / Ajay,

As discussed the request params we get after the auto suggestion from Google autosuggest API are forwarded via ValidateAddressRequest service from OSE and we are getting 0 records on the ValidateAddressResponse from backend systems for the address used or prefilled by Google Auto Suggest API. So OSE is showing ""{*}No Address found{*}"" message over the FE. Please find above Screenshot for invalid address.

Its not OSE s/w issue.

We have compared OGW WS logs for Validate Address service where we have observed same request it triggered in both ACC1 and ACC2 env but ACC1 is receiving successful response from VKD but in ACC2 env we are getting null response.

ok noted, Thank you;;;","27/Jun/25 11:02 AM;ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com;We received feedback from Cable team, but for me its not clear if PHAR file is now correct or not.

I had a look at this file, and the PHAR does contain code requiring PHP 8.1 or 8.2, and psr/log V3.0 - so if it seems to trigger the same error, it isn't and needs more investigation.

I might miss something here, of course, as I only briefly opened the PHAR and looked at readable text. The file itself is effectively a ZIP file, adn I haven't looked if the code inside is correct, I am simply referencing the requirements from {{{}composer.json{}}}. So there may be a *very slim* chance that the build process is picking up outdated old files despite the request for newer ones - I would look at the error messages and logs first.
-> [~bharath.krishnamurthy@vodafone.com]  any idea on this?


Asked TID team if we can copy PHAR file from ACC3 to ACC1 to see if this would help;;;","27/Jun/25 12:10 PM;ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com;PHAR file was copied from ACC3 to ACC1 and now its working fine on ACC1

we have to check still with cable team how to fix it in July catalogue, otherwise it will appear again after over night import ;;;","27/Jun/25 5:28 PM;tanvi.bagade@vodafone.com;Hi all, issue is now resolved & 503 error is not reflected -->
!image-2025-06-27-17-28-18-646.png|width=457,height=257!

Therefore, the ticket can be closed once RCA & resolution is updated;;;","27/Jun/25 6:09 PM;ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com;[~tanvi.bagade@vodafone.com]  this is not a permanent fix

its just a workaround. we still do not know why July catalogue Phar file is not sufficient

it will be broken with next import again probably;;;","30/Jun/25 12:04 PM;ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com;[~tanvi.bagade@vodafone.com]  Please check if issue is still fixed- we had a new Cable update over night lets see if PHAR file is different now again

Contract document is missing in One DMS.

Subject - Confirmation needed for Customer: 935317749 for unavailability of document in OneDMS

Issue Details:
1.The Contract_Document is missing.
2.The Contract_Summary is available, but it was archived under the wrong document class (""Vertragsunterlagen eingehend"" instead of ""ausgehend"").

Expected Result:
the expected workflow is as follows:
-OSF / Order System creates the customer order (e.g. Order ID: 976837).
PAReS system processes the order documents (Contract_Summary and Contract_Document) and marks them as ready for archiving.
OGW (Order Gateway) triggers the archiving process and updates the status: ArchiveCableDocuments.
Cable DMS / OneDMS archives the documents in the appropriate document class.
However, only the Contract_Summary was archived — and in the wrong document class (eingehend instead of ausgehend).

*Hi Kerstin, Hi all,*

Thank you for your support!

I believe many people are currently looped in who may not be able to contribute effectively.

The results themselves are fine—the issue we’re facing now is not related to *BEW* but rather an environmental one.

The entries in *DWH* are also correct.

*[@Lukas Häs, Vodafone (External)|mailto:lukas.haes1@vodafone.com] [@Robert Schäfer, Vodafone (External)|mailto:Robert.Schaefer01@vodafone.com]* – I’ll close this topic and the *IRIS* issue.

 * Discussion/Workshop between VF-DE OSF ACC test team & VF-Group GFP team to find a solution how to test the following error codes
 * Error code 405 ""Method Not Allowed""
 * This error code is received, when tested via APIX. So, the error code 405 is working as designed in APIX.
 * This error code is +not+ received, when tested via DXL:
 * So, DXL may filter/cover this error code 405 or will prevent a request to APIX by the own DXL-error-logic.
 * So, it must be clarified with DXL ([@Sebastian Schier, Vodafone|mailto:Sebastian.Schier@Vodafone.com]), how DXL is designed for this error code.
 * Alternatively, the error-scenario can be tested direct via APIX
 * For that the APIX credentials have been created via the APIC portal: [Login | Developer Portal|https://eur03.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fapix.developer.vodafone.com%2Flogin&data=05%7C02%7Csneha.wayal1%40vodafone.com%7Ca341b78487fb4614f94908ddb95c3f53%7C68283f3b84874c86adb3a5228f18b893%7C0%7C0%7C638870528055287022%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJFbXB0eU1hcGkiOnRydWUsIlYiOiIwLjAuMDAwMCIsIlAiOiJXaW4zMiIsIkFOIjoiTWFpbCIsIldUIjoyfQ%3D%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&sdata=DFDfL8ysgLPAfVOjtiv6Scn1h4%2Fsn2XN%2FslytvlD%2FLk%3D&reserved=0]


 * Error code 409 ""The provided OpCo external Identifier already exists""
 * Initially this error code was requested and implemented
 * With another request the implementation was removed, to be able to re-use a request with the same OPCOID, if the first try was failed by any technically reason
 * So, this requirement (error code 409) is obsolete:
 * So, the requirement must be changed/removed
 * So, the test to receive the error code 409 will +not+ be performed

Everything seems fine on the application side. As of now this appears to be an environment related issue and might be intermittent although we are comparing with previous orders. Can you please retry, if needed we can do it together over a call.;;;","19/Jun/25 6:58 PM;ajay.yashwantbhavar@vodafone.com;Pallavi is checking this issue with Affan.;;;","19/Jun/25 7:17 PM;affan.baragazi@vodafone.com;Hi All,

We found the issue, in AllocateBanAndCtnResponse in the beginning of fulfillment, KIAS is sending us BAN as ""119046735"" and the same is updated in the CDM. Whereas in Completed-Success KIAS set_order_status for subscriber Activation, we are receiving a different BAN ""119046736"". This is resulting in mismatch of subscriberSequence and hence a few mandatory parameters in SetMarketingPermissionsRequest are not being populated as per the implementation. Attaching the AllocateBanAndCtnResponse and the set_order_status received from KIAS for reference. ;;;","20/Jun/25 12:02 PM;ajay.yashwantbhavar@vodafone.com;Hi [~affan.baragazi@vodafone.com] This use case is performed in Telesales channel, Could you please check again as AllocateBanAndCtnRequest should not be called in Telesales channel.;;;","20/Jun/25 12:59 PM;affan.baragazi@vodafone.com;Hi [~ajay.yashwantbhavar@vodafone.com],

The AllocateBanAndCtnRequest is invoked in the Telesales channel for the 'NEW' ActivityType. This can be verified via the Confluence documentation, please find the link attached for your reference.

Thanks for the update, I will check and udpate.;;;","20/Jun/25 3:04 PM;ajay.yashwantbhavar@vodafone.com;Hi [~affan.baragazi@vodafone.com] 
I can see, OGW is not sending BAN and Subscriber Number to KIAS in ActivateSubscriberRequest for Telesales channel, I'm not sure how KIAS will know to Activate same customer which they sent back in AllocateBanAndCtnRequest to OGW.

If I checked same for Retail channel, OGW is sending BAN and Subscriber Number in ActivateSubscriberRequest to KIAS which they received in AllocateBanAndCtnRequest from KIAS.

Please find below Activate subscriber request for 2021746 OGW ORDER ID.

Hi [~elango.durairaj@vodafone.com] 
Based on further discussion it is identified that the IPCC transaction id mentioned over description we didn't find any customer search information.

Looks we used manual search customer over the FE and submitted the order.

We will send DialerPrefixonly if the flow we triggered loaded IPCC/UCT customer successfully and agent submitted order.

In any other manual search and load customer flows we are not sending DialerPrefix;;;","20/Jun/25 11:35 AM;ajay.yashwantbhavar@vodafone.com;Checking same use case of ACC2 env to compare SetPermission interface call.;;;","23/Jun/25 11:52 AM;ajay.yashwantbhavar@vodafone.com;Elango is checking with IPCC Team for their availability to reproduce flow in ACC2 Env.;;;","23/Jun/25 12:29 PM;elango.durairaj@vodafone.com;ACC2 we are facing IBAN issue

just to add some backgrounds to Deepika's information. In IPCC we have a bigger challenge with our Testlab/VIPLab currently. Because of the holiday season in DE stand-ins are rare and/or not available. We have already escalated the issues here. 

As soon as the issues are fixed, we'll let you know . This can be in some hours or also days.

Step to Reproduce:
 # Login to Telesale Channel
 # Place Mobile /DSL with BEW permission
 # Check SetMarketingPermissionsRequest in OGW logs

Expected Result: OGW should send 0 in consentVerificationStatus

 

Actual Result: OGW is sending O instead of 0 in consentVerificationStatus


*NOTE : SetMarketingPermission is failing for Mobile stack due to wrong ""O"" value instead of ""0""   &* 
*no impact on DSL (Even if value is ""O"" instead of ""0"", no Sky tickets for DSL and received response from BE)*
*But 0 value is expected here*

In case of scenario 5 (Follow on activities after Ship2Store order was not picked up by customer in time)  – OGW must handle other status updates than VORAS_FINAL_SUCCESS_SHIP_TO_STORE_HANDOUT once the record is recognized as Mailorder Ship2Store for the first time.

In LNP we do not see any performance issue, Retrieve customer is working as expected.

The response times are similar to Wave 9.1 and wave 9.2 baseline, hence this is issue specifically for ACC environment and not related to performance of the application. Please find the below evidence from LNP environment ->

Hi [~simran.mogram1@vodafone.com] [~ajay.yashwantbhavar@vodafone.com] 

We have reference to Wave 6.1:
*VFDED2W61S-145/ OS-6461* - {*}it is not our case{*}. We do not have ILS scenario here. *ProcessContext = ACQ* for both orders for both packages{*}. Thus, it is not an ILS!!!{*}
*VFDED2W61S-144/OS-6460* - I want to send Physical SIMs to SAP via OIL system - *seems to be our case*



First of all, I want to mention that packages are not totally identical and have differences inside the order.

Let me describe both provided cases. I have compared packages for each order

*OrderID 976877*

some differences are in blue

!image-2025-06-13-20-43-01-707.png!
h3. *The key difference is*

*!image-2025-06-13-20-43-44-676.png!*

*Based on VFDED2W61S-144:*

*!image-2025-06-13-20-44-31-797.png!*

So, the first package does not have SIMCardType = S. Thus, taking into account user story description, MultiSimCount value is 0 and we should not create line '02' !!!

And vice versa for the second package: we have SIMCardType = S. Therefore we transfer '02' record to SAP.

 

We have almost the same case for the second order.

*OrderID 979485*

*the key difference is*

*!image-2025-06-13-20-45-21-301.png!*

*Let`s sum it up:*

Hi Srujana,
 
,As the default is set to one number but the option is disabled hence we don;t port anything here as it is disabled

!f373f7f3-3941-4958-8e98-9d0773302238.png!

We see the number is not sent for porting, its just a UI issue. kindly reduce the priority

Please provide more info:
 - why it should be a Portals Impact because so far only RNS, OM and OSF are involved?

+[~nina.pickl@vodafone.com] ;;;","06/Jun/25 5:36 PM;nina.pickl@vodafone.com;[~anton.ustimenko@vodafone.com] , also VKD is involved, Unity can only communicate with OSF via VKD.

The flow is as follow:  cancellation reason ist trasferred from Unity vo VDK, afterwards VKD is trasferring the reason to OGW/OSF.

If OSF  is not getting the Info from VKD, the reason can not be displayed in OSF.

So the issue is between Unity and VKD and this change was already tested from your side. You can create a Defect against Unity, related to this test task: [[QA] OSF/VKD Gateway/Minerva Adapter - Adjustments Order Manager - Portals - Vodafone DE Confluence|https://de.confluence.agile.vodafone.com/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=599719049];;;","06/Jun/25 6:39 PM;anton.ustimenko@vodafone.com;Ok. I'll double check it - maybe you're right. 

This feature is actually: [[DISPYRAMID-217] Adapt VKDGateway to pass through new order details - DE Jira|https://de.jira.agile.vodafone.com/browse/DISPYRAMID-217] should implement this.

Just for your understanding the root cause:

the cancellation as self seems to be working fine and this is working without Portals systems. RNS communicate in this case directly with OSF systems.

By displaying of information in OM the OSF accessing MinervaAdapter via VkdGateway. And here is probably the issue. I addressed it to team Pyramid as they implemented the extension for cancellation codes in April release 2025.

*Ahmed ElZahaby, Vodafone (Team Pyramid) added a comment -*

I've looked in it, it seems like it's caused because the declined reason isn't founded in the enums that defined in StatusDetails in UnityOrderTracker, so the flow here we 've created an isCancellationReason:

https://webgit.kabeldeutschland.de/projects/LUAAUTO/repos/unityordertracker/browse/UnityOrderTrackerScheduler/src/main/java/com/vodafone/cable/uotracker/updater/data/StatusDetail.java#254-256

That function checks if the order status that returned from MinervaAdaptor exists in CANCELLATION_REASON_MAP value and if it's not it set it with null:

https://webgit.kabeldeutschland.de/projects/LUAAUTO/repos/unityordertracker/browse/UnityOrderTrackerScheduler/src/main/java/com/vodafone/cable/uotracker/updater/vkdgateway/VkdGatewayOrderStatusUpdater.java?at=24d5d4b6d127bf5feee0bb99d80f3f74a73fc7df#63-66

And after I've search for the provided cancellation reason ''STORNO VORVERMARKTUNG'' ('CANCELLATION PRE-MARKETING') I didn't find it in the CANCELLATION_REASON_MAP values.

So, my suggested solution here if the team who is ever responsible for UnityOrderTracker just need to add that cancellation reason into the enums it has in StatusDetails.;;;","13/Jun/25 12:13 PM;atharva.paskanthi@vodafone.com;*Update on PSTBUG*

[~anton.ustimenko@vodafone.com] ,Before I can move forward, I need access to OSF to identify the specific API being called to retrieve the cancellation reason. That step is essential to pinpoint where the issue is occurring and determine whether it’s within our scope.

The OSF team should be able to clarify which API is involved and where the issue lies — their input will help direct the next steps effectively.

We found the place in the VKD logs, where the cancellation reason=cancellation eventCode should be present, but it is missing.

Means the value of the Order Manager field ""STATUS_DETAIL"" is NOT present in the VKD Gateway logs for SOME cancellation reasons.

*Unity is not sending this code via Minera to VKD.* 

Like discussed in the beginning, someone from Cable team should create a Bug for Minerva and Unity team can check the cancellations reasons code table again.

The Unity change was implemented an year ago, maybe in the meantime some new cancellation reasons were added and they the table should now be updated.

 

VKD Log for the NOT working cancellation reason ‚Storno Vorvermarktung':

 

""statusInfos"" : [#012    \{#012      ""statusType"" : ""VALUE"",#012      ""system"" : ""cable"",#012    ""eventCode"" : ""CUSTOMER_ID"",#012      ""eventPresentationText"" : ""new cable customer id 173663507"",#012      ""eventValue"" : ""173663507""#012    }#  +*{color:#de350b}***MISSING PART***{color}*+

 

As example, for other reasons like 'double order', the value is present in the logs and it is also trasferregd from VKD to OSF, is working fine:

 

""statusInfos"" : [#012    \{#012      ""statusType"" : ""VALUE"",#012      ""system"" : ""cable"",#012      ""eventCode"" : ""CUSTOMER_ID"",#012      ""eventPresentationText"" : ""new cable customer id 566519401"",#012      ""eventValue"" : ""566519401""#012    },#012    {#012      ""statusType"" : ""EVENT_DETAIL"",#012      +{color:#00875a}*""eventCode"" : ""UXDU""#012*{color}+    }#012  ]#012};;;","02/Jul/25 9:11 AM;alka.kshirsagar2@vodafone.com;[~anton.ustimenko@vodafone.com] please check comment from Nina and provide your inputs;;;","02/Jul/25 12:29 PM;nina.pickl@vodafone.com;We did further analysis and find out that for some cancellation reasons the EventCodes values are missing in the VKD logs, Minerva didn't send the expected values to VKD.

CR895 ([!https://bmcomviva.atlassian.net/images/icons/issuetypes/story.svg!VFDED2W100S-120: CR895-OMNIUS_CHCK_As Omnius, I want to integrate with the new DXL(emailValidation) service so that customer email can be validated to generate the VFID (OS-66548)Done|https://bmcomviva.atlassian.net/browse/VFDED2W100S-120] )is delivered with the updated endpoint and request body. In the logs, it looks like the old endpoint is in use.

Could you please check and confirm the correct endpoint configuration and what exactly is expected from Omnius.;;;","06/Jun/25 4:21 PM;atharva.paskanthi@vodafone.com;TechM suggested to Schedule a call with Gerd, Shival and Srikrushna.. will check availability and plan;;;","06/Jun/25 4:27 PM;shival.gupta1@vodafone.com;[~daniel.loos@vodafone.com] [~gerd.angress@vodafone.com] 

CR895 (OS-66548) is delivered with the changes over OS-12220 Epic (Changes on OS-27752 Story). CR895 doesn't have switch to roll back the changes. With CR895 changes, new endpoint and request body to be used. To switch off CR895, we have to switch off OS-12220.

To use request body from technical story OS-27752 and to synchronize CR895 - OS-28388, we need to do changes in the code and move CR895 from OS-12220 to OS-28388.

 ;;;","06/Jun/25 5:48 PM;ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com;Discussed with Gerd to try the following setup in test (again)

Error handling OFF but new endpoints set to be able to handle the new request body;;;","07/Jun/25 11:57 AM;ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com;[~atharva.paskanthi@vodafone.com]  [~tanvi.bagade@vodafone.com]  
For now we have switched again to the new endpoint on ACC1 - it should now accept the request

!image-2025-06-07-08-27-25-411.png!

Please retrigger one order and check if unblocked now. 

This might be workaround only.

[~ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com] do we have to keep the ticket Open for tracking the Permanent Fix?
;;;","09/Jun/25 4:30 PM;ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com;[~atharva.paskanthi@vodafone.com]  yes please leave defect open we have to discuss further with [~philipp.roeper1@vodafone.com]  and [~daniel.loos@vodafone.com]  how to handle and if any further checks are required

Therefore its still assigned to vendor TechM, as TechM missed to give switch off for CR895 and maybe we need better solution from them;;;","10/Jun/25 2:28 PM;ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com;Summarized setting and test result via email and informed Wave 10 release manager about workaround, in case no one has any restrictions we can go ahead with this workaround;;;","10/Jun/25 8:25 PM;ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com;With this workaround, we are able to keep VF-ID/Mint integration live – OS -12220 

Impact 
 # Duplicate Emails -> will not blocked, because VF-ID is working only on the code “200” and not on the status  
 # Invalid Emails -> will not blocked, because VF-ID is working only on the code “200” and not on the status  

In both scenarios we will create a VF-ID after the customer has confirmed the CS. 
For the first one Omnius will run in an error (see [OS-23802|https://eur03.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fjira.sp.vodafone.com%2Fbrowse%2FOS-23802&data=05%7C02%7CAriadne.Thun1%40vodafone.com%7C53d99bb8392445a783fa08dda82d1344%7C68283f3b84874c86adb3a5228f18b893%7C0%7C0%7C638851633966437907%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJFbXB0eU1hcGkiOnRydWUsIlYiOiIwLjAuMDAwMCIsIlAiOiJXaW4zMiIsIkFOIjoiTWFpbCIsIldUIjoyfQ%3D%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&sdata=iOGREaLqo8PaBe3M2KN7EaISMu4B2WrVY67epTwQQQE%3D&reserved=0] ) and we will start the fulfillment without providing a VF-ID.

For the second one we will create a VF-ID for an email-address which is not allowed formally and might not run in an error by creation a VF-ID.

Both scenarios will be covered end of August with the error-handling epic.

the issue is that we are sending temp value instead of the ban we get from kias sos

currently i think the issue is because of multiple order line getting multiple set order status messages from KIAS in the span of 20 seconds.
i think the update of the ban values is getting overwritten.

is there a chance to make the same order with a buffer of more then few seconds between the order lines?

TEMS received SBUS PR MQ curdepth alert for “AAW.SBUSHTTP.SBUSOUT” queue by 8:30 AM CET. After receiving alert, we started troubleshooting the issue and below steps are done so far,

 
 # Firstly, we have checked SBUS logs and MQ logs and we have identified connectivity errors for AIR adapters in MQ logs.
 # We have restart http adapter along with SBUS MQ and listener and checked the status. All the channels were up but, still issue with HTTP adapter.
 # For analyzing, AIR adapter queue issue, we have checked AIR adapter MQ logs and Filesystem status, and we identified Filesystem was 100% utilized. We have done Filesystem cleanup and as well as extension with the help of VCI HP-UX Team and restarted AIR adapter MQs along with listeners.
 # We again took complete SBUS restart along with MQ and listener but still messages are not getting processed via HTTP queue and HTTP adapter is going in alarm state in GUI,

 
 # For further analysis, we approached to Development Team and they suggested to enable debug mode for SBUS logs. We have raised CCR INC000094087360 with Deployment Team to enable debug mode. After CCR implementation, we have restarted http adapter and extracted log files suggested by SBUS Development Team.
 # We have shared log files with Development Team and waiting for the analysis.;;;","03/Jun/25 8:41 PM;ajay.yashwantbhavar@vodafone.com;Issue is resolved.

We had a call with SBUS Development Team and as per analysis, two corrupt messages in “AAW.SBUSHTTP.SBUSOUT” queue were causing the issue.

 

Out of these two messages, first messages was Response call to the request, and it was quite old. During troubleshooting call, we were not able to identify why it was stuck in queue and as it was not trying to route to any other queue, we have deleted that message.

 

Second message type was “Message Type :4 (Report)” and this is not a normal behavior. So, for this issue Development Team suggested to raise SPN.

 

As suggested by Development Team, we have removed these messages and restarted HTTP adapter. All the messages are processed successfully,

Based on further discussion it is concluded that the ACC1 is completly missing gigakombitv bundle rules due to which all gigiakombi API’s testcase where cable tv is part of are getting results which are not matching the assertion configured on ready API.

Also we compared the same with ACC2 bundle rules and we can see clearly that gigakombitv are part of PCAT and results are as expected resulting assertion pass

This has to be further conveyed to cable bundle rule team and fixed the rules part or if rules are removed due to some valid reasons then we should ignore or remove gigiakombi testcases from ready API where cable tv is part of.

I'm part of DXL and I can check only in DXL.

As the error is raised in OSF, I think that OSF should explain which data exactly is causing the error, I cannot find the root cause for the OSF issue in DXL or in other systems.

 ;;;","04/Jun/25 3:11 PM;daniel.loos@vodafone.com;Hi [~raniero.calzavara@vodafone.com] thank you for the feedback.
The fact that we received a workflow ID that was displayed seems to indicate that DXL created one initially - afterwards the error message in the frontend reads that no entry exists for this workflow ID.
Can you please check in DXL if this workflow ID exists, if there is an email verification process connected to this workflow ID?;;;","04/Jun/25 3:39 PM;raniero.calzavara@vodafone.com;Hi [~daniel.loos@vodafone.com] 

this will not help further, as you said OSF was showing a workflow ID so if they get it from DXL, it must exist in DXL.

Anyway, I'm not sure what is a ""workflow ID"", if you mean this one Ticket_80001000159349, I see it in the DXL logs in a contact medium verification process around 12:15 CEST;;;","04/Jun/25 4:40 PM;devi.jampana@vodafone.com;Hi [~bharath.krishnamurthy@vodafone.com]

.
*Steps to Reproduce:*
1) Login to Telesales using OSF_Solstice Agent
2) perform Solstice New ACQ order
3) move to extended shopping cart
4) confirm order through CS 

5) Omnius will check for the processOrder/submitOrder(generateContract) response.

6) Omnius will check the configuration table before sending the request DXL for VF ID creation -

   a. If Usecase Identification, PackageType (as %solstice), Segment and Channel combination exist in the configuration table, then Omnius will call the DXL service to generate the VF ID.

 b. If Usecase Identification, PackageType (as %solstice), Segment and Channel combination does not exist in the configuration table, then Omnius will perform BAU to process the order in fulfillment mode.

7) In case of Success(status=Confirmed) response from OGW for processOrder/submitOrder(generateContract), Omnius will initiate the request to DXL to generate the VF ID.

8) Omnius will call the “digitalIdentity” API exposed by DXL.

*Test details:*

Omnius Order ID : 970169

Can see BANCreation date is older than six months. However there was an improvement in TrustedCustomerFlag in OS-63733 to update the calculation based on
 # If the {{BANCreationDate}} is 6 months or older (as per the logic in OS-57791),

 # *AND* {{CollectionDelinquentStatus}} is “N”

 # *AND* {{InternalCreditClass}} is >=1 and

 # *AND* InternalCreditClass is <=2

 # *THEN* set {{TrustedFlag}} = *Yes* in the SubmitOrder request sent to OGW.

In the getCustomerDetail Mode 1 response of the sample attached, I can see that InternalCreditClass = N, which is not a valid value; it has to be a numeric value, anything apart from that will impact the trusted customer flag to be set as N

_the ticket Z_PRT00153851A again needs a rework since DXC implemented the audit Object as mandatory which causes problems in OSF._

_The auditObject which has been added to the SubsidizedHandsetProlongation service must be optional with the fallback to the configured EAI KIAS user (as usual) which is true for all writing interfaces. Otherwise existing client have problems and we cannot update all clients at once._

Hi Ajay,

Customer Password inputfield over UI shown for MOB and DSL customers only. (not for cable)
in following usecases i..e 
MOB : ACQ, X-sell with new BAN. D2C,
DSL : ACQ, MOVE
Introduced in wave-3 ref [!https://bmcomviva.atlassian.net/images/icons/issuetypes/story.svg!VFDED1W3S-1958: Customer Password (‘Kundenkennwort’) Checkout DROP 1Done|https://bmcomviva.atlassian.net/browse/VFDED1W3S-1958]

 

basically captured password not to shown over checkout summary section (before submit)
as it is always in masked over UI and also not add any value to show in masked format.

*Addition* : captured password shown over Order details view (after submit).
where this can be shown either masked or unmasked format based on permission (UNCOVER_PASSWORD)






*Conclusion* : 

Captured password must not shown over checkout summary section (before submit)
It shown over Order details view (after submit).
where this can be shown either masked or unmasked format based on permission (UNCOVER_PASSWORD)

 

Could you please check and update on this;;;","03/Jun/25 12:35 PM;ajay.yashwantbhavar@vodafone.com;Hi [~bharath.krishnamurthy@vodafone.com]

Hi Ajay,
 
We do not need to give a fix for Mobile.

THis is a requirement or a design gap on telesales DSL password summary in telesales because on Telesales Mobile has Ident Method the password is seen in summary Kundenidentifikation

For DSL on Telesales there is no Ident Metho as per design hence customer password is not seen.

Mobile Order on Telesales

!0f3a92b6-c825-4912-944c-5b4d33ead6ec.png!

However, on retail Customer ID is captured in checkout for both DSL and Mobile hence password is seen in summary.

If the same is expected in telesales it is a design gap

Today customer are activated in KIAS .

Please find below test data:

 

119046729;;;","18/Jun/25 12:19 PM;rohan.kumbhar@vodafone.com;As per yesterday's call we had the below things which were done and tried to investigate the scenarios
1.  Defect was retested by testing team and issue was reproduced
2. Amdocs DBA analyzed and debugged the issue where SQL queries were checked and as per DBA they did not identified any issue in SQL statement checks
3. Post Amdocs Dev Analysis it was identified that issue might be due to Media type where only Media type = NT was accepted by the Activation Daemon but media type PA was rejected and what we observed was that the orders from KIAS test team which were directly placed by CSM team had Media type NT but the orders which were placed from OSF had media type PA.
4. Post the above analysis KIAS dev and VF team decided to provide a new Binary file for extra logs debugging which was placed locally in the VF server bin directory and then KIAS was restarted.
5. New flow was triggered and it worked -- but this doesn't seem to be a permanent fix as temporary the orders are flowing and passed but this issue can still occur and not yet fully resolved 

Please do find the overall comments and analysis from Amdocs and VF 
In the last call I was with Andreas Knocke(VF) and Christina(VF) and we agreed that Amdocs check whether there is any dependency on Media Category and Andreas(VF) will approach the OCI Oracle team again. 
As per Amdocs result: There is NO dependency. 
 
In the call with the DBAs yesterday, testers ran the flow but DBAs were not able to see any session. 
The problem seems to be a synchronization issue between the nodes of the distributed database in OCI. This can only be resolved by Vodafone, by the team that managers the OCI cloud DBs. 
 ;;;","20/Jun/25 11:26 AM;ajay.yashwantbhavar@vodafone.com;Issue still persists, Victor, Christina, Mirel and Andreas will check this issue today.;;;","20/Jun/25 2:30 PM;ajay.yashwantbhavar@vodafone.com;*This issue is Resolved. No changes done from KIAS side, KIAS Team is checking on RCA.*

Hi Akash/Ari,

If OS-12220 is ON, and Error Handling Switch is OFF,

 Then Omnius will display warning message only if Response Code is other than 200.

In this case, the response is with Code 200. Therefore, Omnius considers it successful, and there will not be any error message. (Refer to OS-28389 and OS-24967)

 If an error is expected here, then Response Code must be other than 200.

 

Further error handling within Response Code 200 is part of OS-23334 (Epic Error Handling).;;;","02/Jun/25 1:05 PM;akash.ubbu@vodafone.com;Hi [~bharath.krishnamurthy@vodafone.com] ,

Since VF-Id is on, only unique emails should be validated, other emails which are duplicate or previously used an warning error must be shown.;;;","03/Jun/25 8:17 AM;bharath.krishnamurthy@vodafone.com;[~akash.ubbu@vodafone.com] 

Yesterday, had a call with reporter and Omnius BA Shival Gupta

Shival has explained about the epic

for further clarification on this, Akash will discuss with DM team and  will arrange one more call along with Zoltan ,Ari and other VF spoc’s and omnius BA Shival Gupta

Now issue is resolved, error is showing for Duplicate email now.

We needed to change the following endpoint in acc1:

Service Settings -> DXL Settings -> Contact Medium Validation url

 

FROM:                 /osf/v1/emailValidation

TO:                       /osf/v1/tmf-api/digitalIdentityManagement/v4/contactMediumValidation

 

As mentioned in User story [OS-61399] OMNIUS_OSE_As Omnius, I want to add configurable parameter as ON/OFF switch so that I can decide whether the functionalities defined in this Epic need to be enabled or disabled based on parameter value (OS-61399) - Vodafone Global Jira

 
 * Omnius will check the parameter value set in Omnius AdminUI (Backoffice) for *""VFID Error Handling Switch* *""* and take following action based on parameter value.
 * If the configuration parameter indicates that the *""VFID Error Handling Switch""* is enabled (value of parameter = {_}""Yes""{_}), Omnius will enable all the Epic functionalities defined in [OS-28388|https://eur03.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fjira.sp.vodafone.com%2Fbrowse%2FOS-28388&data=05%7C02%7Cakash.ubbu%40vodafone.com%7Ca8f0a9b0a08b401a5c9008dda26f6f44%7C68283f3b84874c86adb3a5228f18b893%7C0%7C0%7C638845321753373264%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJFbXB0eU1hcGkiOnRydWUsIlYiOiIwLjAuMDAwMCIsIlAiOiJXaW4zMiIsIkFOIjoiTWFpbCIsIldUIjoyfQ%3D%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&sdata=%2B7vhHW8TlFmTUvEGgFWdPuTDCBZQcgsAey4HZrAwbbA%3D&reserved=0]:
 * Else (configuration does not exists or value = {_}""No""{_}), Omnius will disable all the functionalities and proceed with BAU.


 * Directly after the initial deployment, the switch will be set as ""No"" (Default value). Later on, it will be considered as the last saved status value.;;;",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Hi Sneha/Zoltan,
 
The submit parameters being sent are in line with OS-59115 & +OS-59153+ ++

Robert opinion is that the described issue is a showstopper and is a defect or design gap. The original shared documents for review are looking identical to our tariff contract.

Currently we have a defect/designgap in OSF AND in OM

To be clarified:  what is the easiest way to get the result of not having hardware on the mobile DF tarif contract , but still be able to create all other documents, that are hardware related

There are different options how to get this result but as far as I understood its not decided yet which way to go:
Alternative1:  OSF remove ALL hardware related parameters and totals in case of DF  (but we think this would effect other documents)
Alternative2:  stick to the original design (as it was intended)  and correct the defects/designgaps in OSF and OM

conclusion:
 # this defect is indeed a defect (in OGW)
 # BUT...  the final solution is not correcting this defect (meaning:  OGW would have to send the HW financing monthly payment SKU to OM), but the decision has been made by the OM team, that OSF (OGW)  must not send ANY hardware data (except the imei) to OM in the mobile contract (portfolio) senddocuments AND removing the amount also from the totals.  ->  design change after new technical requirement from OM.

We have observed that the Subscriber Number is missing in the submit order request fulfillment mode. This is causing KIAS to create a new subscriber number for customer activation, which leads to different subscriber numbers being present in the contract document and KIAS. OGW receives the subscriber number in the AllocateBanAndCtnNumber response from KIAS and passes the same to Omnius in the submit order response and that subscriber number should be sent to OGW from Omnius for order fulfillment in submit order fulfillment mode to activated customer on the same subscriber number. However, due to the missing subscriber number in the submit order request, KIAS assigns a different subscriber number for order fulfillment which resulting in a mismatch between the subscriber number in the contract document and the one used for customer activation.

This issue is working fine in ACC2 Production branch Env - v9.21.12-BB42

We have verified with below customers that RETNOBLU tips are visible to all customers which are eligible for prolongation, except DF customers. Although SV is providing the correct response for DF customers, the tips are still not appearing for them. This issue should be investigated by the TechM team to determine why the tips are not appearing specifically for DF customers.

Could you please check once from your side once and confirm here.

 If you are still facing any issue. If yes then we can check the role assigned to the agent really have permission to filter order or not.

 

Thanks;;;","28/May/25 1:37 PM;suraj.bhor@vodafone.com;Hi

Hi Suraj,
 
Issue is either with Agent dealer shop mapping, configuration or the permission, ideally this has be analyzed with the problematic agent. We tried using the agent having Back-office role and we can see results. It has something to do with how problematic agent got created or mapped to correct dealer shop or not,

May be we can support to understand the same over call. This is not bug on OSE as we can see results for retail store with our agent login.;;;","28/May/25 8:00 PM;ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com;[~bharath.krishnamurthy@vodafone.com]  back office role is not a common role for production anymore, most users are using Telesales now and submit the order.
And not sure how you have used backoffice agent in retail channel.

However, call would be helpful [~atharva.paskanthi@vodafone.com] ;;;","29/May/25 1:37 AM;ajay.yashwantbhavar@vodafone.com;[~gaurav.lanjewar1@vodafone.com] Can you please schedule a call for this issue.;;;","29/May/25 7:24 PM;gaurav.lanjewar1@vodafone.com;Hi [~ajay.yashwantbhavar@vodafone.com]  Call is scheduled for tomorrow.;;;","30/May/25 6:35 PM;suraj.bhor@vodafone.com;Hi All,

We had a call on this issue and we have observed that issue was with  Dealer code assgin permission.

As dealer_id  was assgin for PA agent we can see the status and for FI agent dealer_id are not assgin so we are unable to see the order .

 ;;;","31/May/25 12:38 PM;ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com;With specific Dealer Code ID its working fine so updated the ticket to resolve;;;","31/May/25 1:16 PM;suraj.bhor@vodafone.com;It is working now hences closing this ticket.

Hi Srujana,
 
I checked further on ACC1 due to cable artifact config issue we were not able to reproduce on ACC1 and later after changing configuration now we have validate address issue 

But based on further analysis with info like serviceability we see it is not an issue and expected behavior when we have below the serviceability meet below criteria.

!24021afa-4c1b-40cc-a0d8-49d48cd9119e.png!
h3. Expected Behavior

*Valid for cable TV package*

*selbstInstallationKz* = Y/N AND *ABK* = J
technician_needed_yes  = 1V1 / {*}VP0{*}/ TECYESTV chargeable product should not be added in SC.

*selbstInstallationKz* = Y/N AND *ABK* = N - Remain as is (existing behaviour)
technician_needed_no - default = TECNOTV
technician_needed_yes - manual = 1V1 / {*}VP0{*}/ TECYESTV 

 

*Valid for KIP package*

*selbstInstallationKz* = Y/N AND *ABK* = J
technician_needed_yes - default and readonly = TECYESKIP chargeable product should not added in SC
technician_needed_no - not possbile as dropdown is freez

*selbstInstallationKz* = Y *AND* *ABK* = N - Remain as is (existing behaviour)
technician_needed_no - default = TECNOKIP
technician_needed_yes -  not to show in Dropdown

*selbstInstallationKz* = N AND *ABK* = N - Remain as is (existing behaviour)
technician_needed_yes - default = TECYESKIP
technician_needed_no -  not to show in Dropdown

 

According to this info we can see in check serviceability bar that

*selbstInstallationKz* = Y/N AND *ABK* = N for the address so we show Self installation block

As a part of CR716 , We raised the below defect 

https://jira.sp.vodafone.com/browse/OS-42066

Kindly check the comments on that defect 

After discussion with Timo Russo 

we came to a conclusion that only if 

Order is self install no and ENV Address then ACCess details should be shown (We raised a defect for this 

https://jira.sp.vodafone.com/browse/OS-68396)

 

But for any other , Access details should not be shown 

 

Kindly check

in the current logic i can see we are triggering CreateOptStatement_Request only for telesales

Some releases ago we have done huge testing for permissions and Unitymedia. 

I can see in several defects from the past that both Retail and Telesales are mentioned 
OS-19965 OSF | ACC2 | VKD service setMarketingPermission is called without system crm value. - Vodafone Global Jira
[OS-25961] OSF | ACC2 | Retail | OGW is not triggering SetPermissions call although OIL is sending setPermissions request - Vodafone Global Jira
[OS-19962] BEW Unitymedia issues found in production - Vodafone Global Jira

 

So what exactly is missing here in the original requirements?;;;","27/May/25 5:34 PM;ran.farjun1@vodafone.com;Hi [~ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com] ,

the defect is not about set permission, its regarding an api call we need to do when the stack is UM and channel is Retail inside set permission service.
we have different behavior for Retail and Telesales.

in Telesales during set permission  we are doing a call to anypoint but not in Retail.
adding here the confluence page for set permission: [https://confluence.sp.vodafone.com/display/OF/OGW+Service+30%3A+SetPermission]

First of all, apologies for my delayed response. Regarding the topic, I can only contribute to clarifying the business requirements, as my involvement was limited to the epic preparation.

Hi Simran/Nasir,
 
As discussed on a joint call with VF Acc Testing team, Robert Goebbels, Zoltan Lebanov, Andrey Magas it was found that this is a design gap in terms of requirement. Originally the ask it to submit Infotext1 as part of Recurring order designed as per [!https://bmcomviva.atlassian.net/images/icons/issuetypes/story.svg!VFDED2W92S-119: Omnius_Submit: As a system, I want to send the correct additional information for Package Totals towards OGW for device financing packages, based on the sliding calculator value for the device financing packages[OS-61667]Done|https://bmcomviva.atlassian.net/browse/VFDED2W92S-119] / OS-61667 The ask now is to sent this InfoText 1 only once as part of SKU which has no end_period.

Condition 1: device_financing_duration value is greater than > initial_period value of Tariff
Then Infotext should be : "" Summe bei Kündigung des Mobilfunkvertrags n. Mindestlaufzeit "" (""Amount upon termination of the mobile phone contract after the minimum term"")
OR If InfoText1 is not sent then Omnius must use \{InfoText2 } I.e 
""Summe bei Fortsetzung des Mobilfunkvertrags n. Mindestlaufzeit"" (""Amount upon continuation of the mobile phone contract after the minimum term""). Infotext2 should be printed once. It was concluded that this is a design gap. Omnius to raise a CR to change the logic for sending Infotext 2 (defined inOS-61667) only for LinePayment = REC which has no EndPeriod (or no Sliding_Calculator).
 

Defect ll be open for tracking purpose.

I will make a business story for this.  For TechM this is enough; NO real CR document is needed.

After I have created the Business Story I will link to this issue and to the technical story.

We cannot really analyze the issue as long as we do not have the logs. From the data points mentioned in PSTBUG-3255, we think that the problem is related to the PHP upgrade either on OSE or on PCAT side.

??So it seems we start again to assign tickets back and forth??

Once we have the logs, we hopefully can dive deeper into the analysis. So it would be really nice to have them attached here as requested in the [below comment|https://jira.sp.vodafone.com/browse/OS-73369?focusedId=3711910&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels%3Acomment-tabpanel#comment-3711910].

Based on the assumption that OSE actually uses PHP 8.1 instead of 8.0 (can someone confirm this here?), we have also prepared a new PCAT version and PHAR file (V2500_2025_06_00_062) that drops support for PHP 8.0.

*Observations:*
 # *Order is going to fullfillment started status after completed success again.(Order is not success)*

There is only 1 second difference between ORDER_POSITION_COMPLETE(1286) and ORDER_COMPLETED(1290) *if we are processing order next day*

And {*}OGW is processing ORDER_COMPLETED earlier than ORDER_POSITION_COMPLETE{*}, and hence order goes to fullfillment started status again

Test data: Omnius: 966097 , Barcode: VDE7700008354

!image-2025-05-22-20-19-50-968.png!

*Test Data:*

Test data: FTTH order Omnius: 1092837, Barcode: VDE5602849604

OGW Order id :2849604

*Env* – PR/ ACC1

 

*Step to reproduce:*

1)Login to Omnius with Telesales/Retail channel

2)Configure DSL/FTTH Phase3 Package

3)Submit order

4)Check order status after COM database

6)Verify InProgress-FulfillmentStarted after Completed-Success

*Actual Result:* OGW showing Push Order Status as InProgress-FulfillmentStarted after Completed-Success 

*Expected Result:* OGW should show Push Order Status as Completed-Success for FTTH Phase2 orders

OGW got 3 sos request at the same second: 1 completed success, 2 customer created
currently we reverted the kafka solution that was supposed to handle issues like this.

in the current logic OGW will not wait until the process of handling 1 sos is finished
we are handling all 3 requests simultaneously.

I see this ticket differently, 
And issue i found service error modal is being shown in error case, where this modal shouldn’t be shown at all for all service error cases. basically this error modal info meaningless to Agents. 

In the past design it was agreed to supress the *service error modal* and shows only user friendly message to Agent over UI as Banner (Red/Yellow)


I will check the ticket and share it;;;","28/May/25 5:28 PM;ajay.yashwantbhavar@vodafone.com;Hi [~kshitij.srivastava1@vodafone.com] [~bharath.krishnamurthy@vodafone.com] Instead of True, we are expecting ""Die Adresse konnte nicht automatisch überprüft werden.

The ProcessContext in the NBA tip does not match the ProcessContext in KIAS.
 
Could you please check with KIAS team on this issue.;;;","27/May/25 8:02 PM;sudhir.kute@vodafone.com;Hi [~simran.mogram1@vodafone.com] ,

We have determined that tips are acceptable with the process context ""ILSBLU"". Therefore, this does not appear to be an SV issue. The specific customer is either ineligible for prolongation, or we need to verify the functionality to ensure that the tips are acceptable for Device Financing customers and identify the appropriate process context.

As a result, the ticket should be assigned to the relevant team for further action.

The finance BAN is not created automatically with activation, it has to be created with service *eaiCrFinBan.* 
For your data I can see F-BAN is present for BAN 119044107.

Output from the meeting

Thank you for participating and especially to Nasir and Andreas for analysing the test results during the call.
Unfortunately Amdocs could not participate, so we need a confirmation from Gaurab that our investigation result is correct

Results:
It looks like a Defect in the OGW software:
After the GetMFBan request from OGW to EAI->KIAS
-EAI hands over the F-BAN parameter to OGW
-OGW maps the parameter (so.. no XSD version issue between OGW and EAI)
-OGW does not hand over the F-BAN parameter as part of the GetCustomerDetails response

AccTesting Ticket has been sent to Amdocs:
OS-73161] OSF | Wave10.0 | ACC1 | Omnius is not sending GFP call for existing customer of device financing - Vodafone Global Jira
It includes the test logfiles from OGW/EAI

TODO: Amdocs (please until Monday 12:00 CET) :
-confirm that indeed it is accepted as an OGW defect
-deliver expected delivery date for fix

@Gaurab Mitra
In case of any questions, please call nasir.sayyad@vodafone.com, because he has performed the tests and has direct access to the logfiles on the test environment.
If another meeting is needed, please invite for Monday morning or ask me to do that

THANK YOU!!;;;","25/May/25 11:39 AM;ran.farjun1@vodafone.com;Hi,
i commented in the other defect: OS-73161, i will add it here as well:

according to US: OS-57829
 # {color:#403294}OGW will introduce a new configurable field named BlockFinanceBAN under configuration having valid values ['No','Yes'] with defaulted as 'No' and can be updated by Operation.{color}
 # OGW will map the same towards OMNIUS in GetCustomerDetails mode-1 in newly introduced BANCreationDate and FinanceBAN field(s) .{color:#403294}The FinanceBan will only be mapped if BlockFinanceBAN parameter is set as 'No' .{color}

{color:#172b4d}Currently i can see that in ACC1 the value is YES, meaning F-BAN will not be in the response. you can change this value without restart in jesi admin.{color}
need to change this: BLOCK_FINANCE_BAN to No.

also, this is relevent only for mode1, i saw you put in the attachments mode 2 and 3. 
{color:#172b4d}F-BAN is only mapped for mode 1 only{color};;;","26/May/25 3:42 PM;nasir.sayyad@vodafone.com;Hello 

Issue has been resolved hence closing this issue

It makes of course no sense to put a device name under the monhtly charges if there are no device financing  monthly payments

Hi Sneha,
 
We can see that the product name for device is displayed or not displayed conditionally as designed in [[VFDED2W62S-125] Omnius SUBM As a customer, I want to see a product names without prices on contractual documents, to have correct information [OS-7961] - JIRA BMComviva|https://bmcomviva.atlassian.net/browse/VFDED2W62S-125]

Hi Sneha,

Findings: As per [VFDED2W92S-116: Omnius_OSE_Submit: As a system, I want to set the logic for the Device SKU's StartPeriod & EndPeriod for ACQ Mobile orders based on Mobile Mix match file attributes for Device Financing Hardware towards OGW [OS-61717]{*}Done{*}|https://bmcomviva.atlassian.net/browse/VFDED2W92S-116] /OS-61717 The ask was  to send the SlidingPriceList for *CommercialDetails for PackageSubType = Device / Under LinePaymentInterval = OTC only for the condition that the* Mobile Mixmatch file where the device_financing_indicator (boolean) = true

However, we saw that for the Non-Device Financing use case, the SlidingPriceList node was sent in ProcessOrder/SubmitOrder.

IBAN filling will be offered for existing customers if the mode response does not give the IBAN which indicates that IBAN was not captured during customer’s ACQ flow initially. Please ask them to test with a scenario where mode response gives the IBAN value

Output from the meeting

Thank you for participating and especially to Nasir and Andreas for analysing the test results during the call.
Unfortunately Amdocs could not participate, so we need a confirmation from Gaurab(?) that our investigation result is correct

Results:
It looks like a Defect in the OGW software: 
After the GetMFBan request from OGW to EAI->KIAS
-EAI hands over the F-BAN parameter to OGW
-OGW maps the parameter (so.. no XSD version issue between OGW and EAI)
-OGW does not hand over the F-BAN parameter as part of the GetCustomerDetails response

AccTesting Ticket has been sent to Amdocs:
OS-73161] OSF | Wave10.0 | ACC1 | Omnius is not sending GFP call for existing customer of device financing - Vodafone Global Jira
It includes the test logfiles from OGW/EAI 

TODO: Amdocs (please until Monday 12:00 CET) :  
-confirm that indeed it is accepted as an OGW defect
-deliver expected delivery date for fix

@Gaurab Mitra
In case of any questions, please call nasir.sayyad@vodafone.com, because he has performed the tests and has direct access to the logfiles on the test environment.
If another meeting is needed, please invite for Monday morning or ask me to do that


THANK YOU!!

;;;","23/May/25 6:00 PM;nasir.sayyad@vodafone.com;As analyzed from meeting

After the GetMFBan request from OGW to EAI->KIAS
-EAI hands over the F-BAN parameter to OGW
-OGW maps the parameter (so.. no XSD version issue between OGW and EAI)
-OGW does not hand over the F-BAN parameter as part of the GetCustomerDetails response

Hence issue is assigned to OGW.

Please find attached GetMFCustomerBAN request and response.

{color:#172b4d}Currently i can see that in ACC1 the value is YES, meaning F-BAN will not be in the response. you can change this value without restart in jesi admin.{color}
need to change this: BLOCK_FINANCE_BAN to No.

Hi Natasa/Ran ,From omnius perspective the Firmenname is optional, So if agent doesn’t enter as it is optional. hence we don’t send it in submit order.

If the same field is mandatory at OGW because of which SKY ticket is created, then there is a gap between 2 application ,request to let us know what is expected from omnius ?

Sky Ticket: 

!image-2025-07-02-08-23-45-331.png!;;;","02/Jul/25 3:35 PM;tobias.pohlmann@vodafone.com;This problem seems to exist for longer and in different forms, for example this one from 2024: https://jira.sp.vodafone.com/browse/OSIP-1486 

[~joerg.trierweiler1@vodafone.com] investigated it and it seems like the problem is the following:
 * there are different places where a SOHO customer can enter a company name: in the customer details, the delivery options, the billing address
 * for a new customer order, the OSF frontend only forces the agent to enter the company name in the customer details; but if additional billing address or delivery options are given, the frontend makes it optional to enter the company name
 ** however, when such an order is send, OrderGateway creates a SkyForce ticket because the company name is missing => OSF frontend thinks the company name is optional, OGW seems to think it is mandatory
 * for existing customers the problem seems to be worse, because loading a SOHO customer pre-enters the company name in the customer details, but not for the other fields. 
 ** even if no deviating delivery address is chosen, OGW deems it mandatory and refuses the order

These orders do not arrive in VkdGateway, so the cable side never actually gets to see this. We do not understand how the validation in OrderGateway works, so we need TechM to investigate this further.

In ECC, the company name is also mandatory, but here the frontend supports that validation and does not allow you to actually check out and generate a wrong order.

I currently am not sure if there are additional validations down the line in the cable stack that would act up, too, when the company name is missing. We are in contact with colleagues about this.

But the problem at hand seems to stem from OrderGateway and cable has no way to investigate this much deeper.

We would need to know:
 * what validations for the company name existing OrderGateway
 * or more specifically for the case at hand: why are these order failing when placing an order for a new customer with additional delivery details?

[~ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com]  [~natasa.dimovic1@vodafone.com] 

Under Checkout delivery section for delivery method (different delivery address) inputbox “Firmenname“ is an optional input and it is designed since wave4. So working as designed

This is not a defect.

Also it was never requested to make this input field mandatory form UI.

If this input-field become mandatory in downgrade system (OGW/VKD) during fulfilment than this change must be done in Omnius as well. And I see this demand was missed to Omnius sol.

Either this could be handle as new demand or exiting demand OSF-14 can expand to cover SOHO usecase as well.;;;","16/Jul/25 4:17 PM;natasa.dimovic1@vodafone.com;Hi [~tobias.pohlmann@vodafone.com] it seems that VKD Gateway is not accepting this order and that's why it is failing with a Sky ticket.

OGW failure – > failed in initial queue

Sky ticket – > follow-up system refuses the order

If it would be mandatory field on OSF side, it would fail in earlier step already .

From our analysis its rejected from VKD Backend because this field is empty, so either VKD backend has to mark this field as optional (like its for OSF) or new request against OSF has to be raised.

Could you please check that again?

Thanks;;;","18/Jul/25 2:14 PM;tobias.pohlmann@vodafone.com;Hi [~natasa.dimovic1@vodafone.com]  [~vikash.saurav@vodafone.com] 

Do you think it would be possible to talk to a TechM colleague directly? I feel like this is going back and forth without any progress.

We are very certain that this is not a a VkdGateway behaviour, because in our logs, this order does not even arrive. Also, our systems don't have a validation for a mandatory company name, and the nomenclature COMPANY_NAME isn't used by us at all.

Also, the Sky-Tickets are not created by us, but by OSF. It may usually be a reaction of OSF to VkdGateway refusing an order – I cannot judge that, I cannot see OSF code. But then, it would be very nice if they could tell us what VkdGateway call supposedly refuses that order. Since they are writing the Sky tickets, they should be able to see that.

 

I believe it would be easiest if I could get in contact directly with them, so that this conversation is not mediated by you poor people. Do you have an idea who I could contact for this?;;;","18/Jul/25 4:11 PM;ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com;Hi Tobias, you can get in touch with Vikash or with Affan from Amdocs side

I think we had several calls already :(

[~atharva.paskanthi@vodafone.com]  please plan another call to check again, which process step expects this value for company name. Also with Amdocs please

 

So you mean to say, for cable its not a mandatory field to have the company name for SoHo customers in the different delivery adress and it should not be rejected by backends? 

 ;;;","18/Jul/25 8:07 PM;tobias.pohlmann@vodafone.com;Hi [~ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com] , 

yes, exactly. From the digging we did, we did not find any validation that checks for the company name being present. Also, the phrase ""COMPANY_NAME"" written as it is is something we do not use. I would hope that the colleagues from OSF could find in their code when the ""Required Input COMPANY_NAME missing"" error is constructed and written into the OGWERR-1408.

For us, it is completely intransparent how this error comes to be.

OSF and/or OrderGateway take these deliveryDetails entered in the frontend, and we could imagine that there is some validation in OrderGateway itself that causes the problem (but we can't know for sure). [~natasa.dimovic1@vodafone.com]  mentioned that a Sky-Ticket by OSF is usually created only when the cable systems refuse the order. I guess this would need to be the *orderNewCustomer* endpoint of VkdGateway, but we do not receive any calls on that endpoint in these cases. If this is in fact a reaction of OSF to some refusal by the cable systems, it would be very helpful to know what call OSF/OrderGateway is doing and what the response is from VkdGateway that causes OSF to write Sky-Ticket.

I hope communication is easier when we can directly talk to the colleagues, because the communication over this ticket seems to be very not ideal anymore.

 

(Regarding validations in our systems: the only validation that we have in regards of these customer addresses is that the deliveryDetails and billingInformation etc. – so all these extra customer details – must either all be for a private person or all be for a legal person (SOHO), but never mixed.  So, currently, we do not allow that a SOHO customer (customerPersonType = ""SOH"") enters a private address (deliveryPersonType=""KUN"").

But I am not aware of any cases where this caused problems yet in the communication with OSF – which might only be me being uninformed of course.);;;","21/Jul/25 12:23 PM;atharva.paskanthi@vodafone.com;Hello all, meeting is scheduled for tomorrow 2:30 CET;;;","21/Jul/25 5:59 PM;tobias.pohlmann@vodafone.com;Thank you very much!;;;","22/Jul/25 6:29 PM;atharva.paskanthi@vodafone.com;*OSF | Wave10.0 | Checkpoint | DM | OS-73030 | ACC1 | MoM and Action items (22nd July, 2025)*

The 1st one disallows VF Cover+ for Soho and Business customers whereas the 2nd one generally allows it.

It seems that OAF-750 did not consider the existence of the 1st one. As the rules for OAF-750 are generated directly by PAPS the issue has to be addressed and fixed in PAPS.

We checked with and without the 20FX permission in BO, and the same error appears in both cases.

OAF-810 Part -3 : OMNIUS, CUST : As an Agent, i wanted to authenticate via service pin cable in harmonized way, so that if spin_cab fails, system offer next authentication method in harmonized manner. - Vodafone Global Jira

OAF-798 Part -3 : OMNIUS, CUST : As an Agent, I wanted to retrieve possible authentication method from system based on customer and agent, so that system perform hard authentication in harmonized manner. - Vodafone Global Jira

As per Above user story, assigning SPIN_CAB should show the SPIN_CAB window first. The error (Customer can't be authenticated at the moment due to no authentication method available) should only appear if it's skipped and no permission is set. So, the SPIN_CAB window should not depend on the 20FX permission.

 

Please let us know if we missed anything.

Now based on the request -- OGW shall create a record for async process with flow vfde_ident_get_ident_status.xml which i see is created but post that  OGW shall invoke vfde_orchestration_main_flow.xml -- which I dont see OGW is invoking 
reason may be its triggering and due to which next flow of vfde_prd_mobile_post_main_flow.xml
 is not getting called which inturn calls document creation of ident to OM

So OGW needs to check why the values are not picked from GetIdent status and further flows arent invoked.
Not sure but I think it might be invoking the Flow=sv/vfde_get_ident_sv_flow.fxml; even though indicator is Off but OGW to check on this

im checking with the BA if the value of externalRequestId  is correct.

meanwhile can you also check with EAI if the value that we are sending is what they are expecting?

seems the main issu is the activity type, CHANGEPRODUCT

currently the mapping is only for:

NEW = 'N'

DEBIT TO CREDIT = 'D'

update:

BA suggested:

For ChangeProduct and ChangeTariff we can use CP and CT , and P for Prolongation.

[~ajay.yashwantbhavar@vodafone.com] can you also check with EAI regarding this?;;;","12/May/25 5:17 PM;ajay.yashwantbhavar@vodafone.com;Hi [~ran.farjun1@vodafone.com] Thanks, Yes sure, We will check with EAI and KIAS BA.;;;","12/May/25 6:37 PM;ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com;[~ran.farjun1@vodafone.com]  but you set it to fixed so amdocs found the root cause and will fix it?;;;","13/May/25 2:42 PM;anuradha.chougule@vodafone.com;Hello

yes, we know the root cause, externalRequestId is too long, more then 25 chars.

For KIAS is the value itself irrelevant, it will be only displayed in CSM OL window. But it must allow the user in case of Manual Handling to identify the OSF order.

Hi Priya/Srujana,

 

Here we see nothing is coming in response of the legacy search customer,
<DATA xmlns="""">
<RowCount>0</RowCount>
</DATA>
so it has no data to display.
Please check what is the request going and coming in legacy search customer

 

Could you please provide legacy search request and  response logs  from both OGW and OSE

if no data is coming from OGW then it needs to be checked by OGW side.;;;","12/May/25 7:07 PM;devi.jampana@vodafone.com;Hi [~rohan.kumbhar@vodafone.com] 

We are trying to search Unity customers through Legacy search and we are getting 0 row count from OGW Response

ACC1-->Test2b-->UAT06 was agreed and connected since 24.03.2025 but today we observed that Test2b flows were moving sometimes to UAT05 and UAT06 which caused interruptions

Checking with Nestor team for the same:-
Hello Nestor, could you please check if the Minerva/Cama configuration for test2b is being overwritten by anything? Yesterday and earlier today i saw the correct configuration (MinervaUAT). However currently i see that according to the endpoint report /minerva is wrongly configured now: 
.
 
Since end of March we should have the following VF West endpoints configured: 
I think this is causing issues for OSF with their orders ending up in the wrong VF West environment. 
Thus can you please look into it and correct the configuration? ;;;","15/May/25 11:01 AM;devi.jampana@vodafone.com;ACC1 Backend connection is pointing to minerva instead of minervaUAT

Then it needs to be evaluated from the PCAT loaded in ACC1. The visibility of Tariff in configurator is driven by PCAT rules and Omnius has no block on it.;;;","09/May/25 11:14 AM;kevin.broeggelwirth@vodafone.com;On SB2 it is working since ever, so no PCAT Issue: !screenshot-1.png|thumbnail! ;;;","09/May/25 11:24 AM;ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com;[~kevin.broeggelwirth@vodafone.com]  you have Wave 10 software on SB2 and same PCAT like we also have on ACC1?;;;","09/May/25 6:15 PM;horst.froehlich3@vodafone.com;Hi all,
we checked it few minutes ago in addition on SIT1 with same PCAT mobile as on ACC1 and it works perfectly fine.
Means this is not a PCAT issue and detailed investigation by TechM is needed.

As discussed, we had a code fix on the script server (JS file) as part of the delivery, but the fix did not work in ACC on the same day of deployment. When we tested the same ticket the next day after the automatic import and publish, everything worked perfectly fine.

Additionally, we have observed that the ""OS-72625 Ticket"" started working as expected after the automatic PCAT import and publish. This seems to indicate that whenever we implement a JavaScript fix, the functionality does not work as expected on the same day due to cache issue.

Could you please check if there are any additional jobs or scripts utilized to clear the cache after the automatic publish, It would be helpful if you could provide a script to the deployment team to clear all caches, including both web and script server caches.

Two point we have.

1)If any java script file delivered as patch , we have to put instruction in MCF to clear the varnish cache before test.

Hi Srujana,

As discussed, can you please attach the issue test result document for the scenario

*VKD TO VUM Flow*;;;","12/Jun/25 12:11 PM;devi.jampana@vodafone.com;Steps:

Take VKD Customer in ULM Address(935270411/935297358)

Move to Unity Address:(89073 Ulm Adlerbastei  2)

select Kable internet and  phone

Select any KIP Product

Move forward and check the porting Section:

!image-2025-06-12-12-09-42-839.png|width=462,height=260!

Keine Ruffnumber is selected by default

But as per CR869-- Move from VKD TO VUM within same area code then 

Section ""Anzahl der zu übernehmenden Rufnummern"" needs to reflect the quantity of phone numbers of the former VKD-contract.

Please make a note while testing ,If we have a product which belongs to [ume_option_homebox |https://st8-telesales-vfde.comviva.com/index.php/implement/catalog_product/edit/id/7136/key/b5bccbb18cd3843d26e8441e321479e1/#]category in SC then we see upto 6 porting number
similarly If we have product from [ume_option_voice2 |https://st8-telesales-vfde.comviva.com/index.php/implement/catalog_product/edit/id/7136/key/b5bccbb18cd3843d26e8441e321479e1/#] category in SC then we only see upto 2 porting number even though the customer has 3 numbers in IB.

Else we see 2 options (1 nummber and no number)

We had a call with TID and QA team on this now and identified the it's the cache issue where old java script file still cached and that prevent the functionality to use .now we will check again tomorrow after PCAT import  basically a symptom alike prod patch (IBN) which worked next day so tomorrow we will check again, There is high chance that PCAT import is clearing some cache in background which help this ..may be varnish cache or something

As discussed yesterday, we have retested this Ticket, now functionality is working fine as expected, seems whenever we implement a JavaScript fix, the functionality does not work as expected on the same day. However, it seems to resolve itself post the automatic PCAT import and publish the next day.
 
Could you please check if there are any additional jobs or scripts that are being used to clear the cache after the automatic publish.
 
We will keep this defect open for permanent solution.

There are 2 conditions

point1 - when the offer is loaded ,there are validations being run and if the validations fails then the offer is directed to checkout page,in this case the BEW is editable

point2 -when the offer is loaded, validation pass, then it is directly loaded to voicelog page, here it is read only.

Hi Ajay,
 
The customer will be asked for BEW if he has not selected I agree, from marketing point of view VF would like to insist on accepting BEW when he reopens the saved offer.

Yes, for prepaid we don't have contract summary but if agent has submitted order (Generate contract mode - submit order trigger) then Omnius should not allow agent to change anything in checkout without refreshing page, Can you please check with [~kshitij.srivastava2@vodafone.com]  :);;;","08/May/25 8:21 PM;vikash.saurav@vodafone.com;Kshitij Kumar Srivastava added a comment -

This is an standard/generic behaviour in Omnius before SubmitOrder(fulfilment) service call, agent can go back and edit anything.
And until SubmitOrder(fulfilment) service call, shoppingcart+checkout data consider as offer in Omnius.

There is not such restriction in Omnius for prepaid package/order after SubmitOrder (generateContract) to go back in sales flow and edit sc or checkout.

So this is not a valid.

KIAS Team is checking this issue.;;;","07/Jun/25 4:37 PM;ajay.yashwantbhavar@vodafone.com;We have observed that whenever an OSF order fails in KIAS for any reason, KIAS is not sending the OGWOrderLineID (OGWSubscriberId - IETRX_P3 ""EXT_SUB_ID"") in the set order status response towards OGW. Due to this issue, OGW is unable to identify for which order package they need to update the response. As a result, they are updating the response for both packages due to which Postpaid order details are shown in Prepaid package (In case of Multipackage scenario).We have observed ietrx_p3 id is empty in ie_transactions table in case of failure scenario.

Mail sent to [~katarina.poltakova@vodafone.com] for further check.

 ;;;","11/Jun/25 2:18 PM;ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com;I assume based on the last analysis from Mirel we have to assign to Amdocs right?



I double checked current Production status for the last 7 days – for IETRX_P4 = ‘ACTERR’, KIAS does not send a value in IETRX_P3 field.

For all other values in IETRX_P4, KIAS sends a value in IETRX_P3, but not for ACTERR, and this makes sense, as the error (data validation, exception, or final exception) impacts the whole order, and not specific subscribers in the order.So, please check why OGW behavior changed with BSS46. We need this analysis asap, otherwise it will fail in Production from 22.06.;;;","11/Jun/25 10:52 PM;ajay.yashwantbhavar@vodafone.com;Call is scheduled to discuss this issue with KIAS VF BA and Amdocs BA.;;;","12/Jun/25 5:44 PM;ajay.yashwantbhavar@vodafone.com;As discussed in Today's call, [~katarina.poltakova@vodafone.com] has identified, this is Design gap from KIAS side in case of OSF order failure in KIAS, She will be checking this issue with Mirel and KIAS Team to investigate further and provide update.

FYI: [~ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com] ;;;","17/Jun/25 4:07 PM;ajay.yashwantbhavar@vodafone.com;There is no possibility to switch this handling of Error completely to order line level, as for Multiorder there are activities which takes place on Order and BAN level at first and only if this is successful the processing on order line and Subscriber level starts. Theoretically the error handling of processing on order line / Subscriber level starts could be “improve”.

[~suraj.bhor@vodafone.com]  - Checked with developer There is an error code sent in response for Contract Generation Request. Hence the agent in this case will not be able to check the Signosign checkbox which will prevent loading DF contract section.

Error “Contract summary is not ready yet, please try again after a couple of seconds"" is working based on previous implementation OS-3609/VFDED2W60S-11 (Evaluated by Krishna).

This needs to be evaluated by OGW as to why ERR-7004 is generated.

The previous signosign (of Mobile Contract) is the pre-requisite for showing the DF contract section. If the signo-sign is not checked Omnius will not show the DF contract section and for Signosign to be enabled the Mobile contract must be downloaded;;;","06/May/25 6:00 PM;suraj.bhor@vodafone.com;We will recheck this issue once below issues are resolved.

Hi 

I discussed further with @Bas Smeets found that the issue is because of Files from cable_artifact.phar/vendor folder which are running on PSR/LOG-1.1.0 version are trying to refer the dependencies of OSE/vendor folder having PSR/LOG-3.0.0 version. This version mismatch is causing the issue.

To solve the same we either need to work on how we load or manage dependencies of OSE / InstallBase API & the Cable Artifact.

or we need to convey the challenges we have and ask the Cable artifact team to upgrade the PSR/LOG version to latest >= 3.0.0

 

Thanks;;;","15/May/25 12:14 PM;vikash.saurav@vodafone.com;SunilkumarCM added a comment -

As discussed in call,
 - As per Sven Rautenberg, TechM Code is using 2 different versions of same software
 - Also there are multiple LoggerInterface files & the Autoloading is somehow using whichever may be latest
 - We need codebase which can support both PHP version 7 & 8
 - Sunil will try to downgrade psr log file and check if it works
 - If doesn't work, will have to ask Cable Artifact team to upgrade it
 ;;;","15/May/25 5:49 PM;atharva.paskanthi@vodafone.com;Comment from Sunil over mail : 

Hi team,
 
We checked further and found that downgrading the PSR/LOG is not an easy option as InstallBaseAPI built on Luman framework is of version 10, which uses package ""monolog/monolog"", intern this package is expecting at least ""psr/log"": ""^2.0 || ^3.0"" version.
So conclusion is Downgrade is possible only on our OSE S/W but not on InstallBaseAPI S/W we have.
 
Possible solution which can be checked by cable-rules-plugin.phar team are like,
 
1.	To get rid of the problem permanently we could use something like https://github.com/humbug/php-scoper
 
php-scoper add-prefix
This will prefix all relevant namespaces in code found in the current working directory. The prefixed files will be accessible in a build folder. You can then use the prefixed code to build your PHAR.
or 
 
2.	As discussed over call we can ask cable-rules-plugin.phar team for upgrade of PSR/LOG version to 3.0.0

Hi Ari,

 

We have checked the files and logs on ACC1, found due to deployment issue we see old software package files still present on ACC1 Web servers, due to which there is conflict and we get 503 issue for cable ILS flow(OS-73248).

To resolve the same on ACC1 we asked below steps to perform during the deployment.
 # Remove of vender folder completely from ACC1 OSE WEB server before starting deployment.

 # After the deployment we can place the new phar file share by cable rules plugin team and run/test both ACC1 FE and InstallBase API flows which are blocked. For this we are scheduling call with Pramod after deployment completion

OS-73369 is completely new issue and it has no connection with cable phar old or new. For this also we checked and found some logs that Pramod can add into ticket.

Thanks;;;","27/May/25 1:09 PM;ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com;The problem is not OS-73369 - we know its different issue

i thinks there is some mindreading here.
according to cr888:

Fetch <FrontendUserId> from the Event tag of SetPermission API call and keep the information as SetPermissionAgentID underContext

in set permission agent id is FrontendUserId is digitalusername . and it is  5791

in cdm, after submit request, there is also agent id that is not connected to this user story, in that mapping agent id is the creator from submit request, aka: <Creator>Charan.gangiredla1</Creator>

im adding the the set permission input and the cr document

The issue  is due to {*}locale settings{*}. In many European locales (like German), the comma {{,}} is used as a decimal separator instead of a dot.

so when we are using java its taking the comma instead of dot.
this is why we are getting bad request;;;","04/May/25 5:58 PM;ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com;[~ran.farjun1@vodafone.com]  do we get a patch to fix it or do we need to change something manually? ;;;","05/May/25 11:52 AM;ran.farjun1@vodafone.com;i can create a patch for it;;;","05/May/25 11:55 AM;ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com;fine Ran, please deliver as a patch :);;;","05/May/25 12:22 PM;deepak.garg1@vodafone.com;Hi [~ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com] ,

h2. Solution Design for required OGW fix

In case an extended phone book entry is requested by OSF, the complex element “custom-phonebook-data” as part of the eShop order request has to be used. This element requires at least the following mandatory elements provided within this (including further mandatory elements required): See attached .xlsx and the related order.xsd attached for documentation and verification purpose.
 * For SKU 'SDE01' additional phonebook-data either via element 'standard-phonebook-data' or 'custom-phonebook-data' is mandatory.
 * For SKUs 'SDE02', 'SDE03' an element 'custom-phonebook-data' is mandatory, element 'standard-phonebook-data' is not allowed.
 * The element 'standard-phonebook-data' is only allowed for customers of type 'private'.
 * Customers of type 'soho' or 'business' need to use the element 'custom-phonebook-data', element 'standard-phonebook-data' is not allowed.
 * The element 'custom-phonebook-data' has sub elements 'section' and 'keyword' that are mandatory for customers of type 'soho' or 'business', but are not allowed for customers of type 'private', see below.

h2. Mapping enhancements for ""custom-phonebook-data""

For to  better readability, please refer to attached documents

 ;;;","05/May/25 12:07 PM;lukas.haes1@vodafone.com;Hi [~ran.farjun1@vodafone.com] 

I dont think amdocs will get a CR for this topic, because it is no new functionality at this point and implemented in the first waves of OSF. So it is a relaly old functionality.

As alrady mentioned this defect is blocking CR876 which is using this old functionality, so a really quick solution from amdocs is needed.

 #  This change is related to the eShop/Tivano interface, not COM. Below the custom-phonebook-data type I could only find some enums, but no arrays. No special order for the elements is required.
 # Don't expect this... --> 
 #  ---> just poplulated from PhoneBookEntryPersonalDetails/LastName
 # Good point: The GUI supports both values independent from each other, mean it may be the case that a ""Y"" for electronic as well as a ""Y"" for print is added to the order:-In this case, it should be mapped to ""both"".

When you select a product from package subtype “Device” or “Tariff” or even “Sknum” then the selected item is added to the shopping cart and all other products from the same subtype become invisible. And when you want to change your selection again then you first have to deselect the product, and all other products become visible again. So far so good.

For customer types SOHO/RV and Firma/RV this only works for the first package subtype “Sknum” but not for the subsequent subtypes ""Device"" and ""Tariff"".

Actually, there is
 * no related comp rules/CRAC which might define this behavior
 * no mutually exclusive category defined

Assumption:

The defined default cardinality of the package subtype could the reason for the above mechanism. 
|*package_subtype_id*|*package_subtype_name*|*package_subtype_gui_sorting*|*default_cardinality*|
|Sknum|Rahmenvertrag|10|*{color:#de350b}0...1{color}*|
|Device|Hardware|20|*{color:#de350b}1...1{color}*|
|Tariff|Tarif|30|*{color:#de350b}1...1{color}*|
|Option|Optionen|40|0...n|

|Fee|Sonstiges|70|0...n|
|ConfigurableCheckoutOptions|Checkout Products|80|0...n|

Timo as suggested this to Thomas Wermke to modify the PCAT

Hi Thomas and Shruti,

 

As far as it is known to me, whether other products are shown under the same package_subtype after selecting a product of that subtype depends on compatibility rules and not on the attribute ‘default_cardinality’ (or other cardinality rules).

 

‘Default_cardinality’ and ‘ilsblu_cardinality’ are only evaluated while proceeding from configurator to extended shopping cart. At that moment it is evaluated if the shopping cart content adheres to the cardinality rules (and thus, not during configuration in configurator).

 

See below example of DSL. The frontend displays other tariffs after selecting the tariffs although the ‘default_cardinality’ is 1…1.

 

 

 

 

@Thomas Wermke Please double check the rule with operation ‘not allowed’ where the behavior is not as you expect (or check with DSL reference data team how it is configured there).

 

@Shruti Kanchan Please check with development after the check of Thomas if it is still not in line with what is expected.

 

{*}Disclaimer{*}{_}:{_} since I have been in the BlueMarble project for almost 2 years now, I am not fully up to date to the latest status of V2, but what you see above is what I recall.

Hi [~ajay.yashwantbhavar@vodafone.com] 
 
This ticket is not about capturing of DOB topic.

basically Capturing and visibility are two different behaviour.

So, visibility of DOB over 360 view within same salesflow or dfifferent salesflow is custom.
and DOB and nationality will not show over UI customer 360 for left top panel for SOHO customer type. ref OMNVFDE-301;;;",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Hi Ajay,
 
Implementation looks very old and not recent changes to show or hide those Pre-Order details.
 
As part of eSIM push Epic there was no requirement to hide the Vorbestellung label. Changes were implemented for SIM selection and linking logic

Could you please provide the US or Improvement details for this scenario to investigate further.

Hi Ajay,

Hi Ajay,
 
Vorbestellung label is a byproduct of the Pre-Ordering Hardware selected in the configurator
This also needs to be check with VF BA - Rob or Andrey. This was not specifically changed as part of Wave 10.0 epics

I can only contribute not much more than Shruti:
 # we did not design any changes for this lable.
 # My assumption is:  software works correct:
 ## you have configured in PCAT Hardware with the flag/attribute:  PRE-ORDER hardware, in order to test the pre-order cancellation use-case for device financing
 ## Wenn hardware is configured in PCAT like that, this ""VORBESTELLUNG"" lable is appearently shown in CheckOut.  I can only guess, that this is ""IS SITUATION""  and would also appear if you would test with software of Version 8.1, 8.2, 9.0, 9.1....  But.. I can only assume that, because I don't know this pre-order functionality that well.
 ## So.. from my / Device Financing perspective:  all okay
 ## If you feel not sure, if this is a bug, then perhaps Andreas Baldermann can help
 ## otherwise:  just cancel the ticket;;;","20/May/25 8:38 PM;ajay.yashwantbhavar@vodafone.com;Thank you [~robert.goebbels@vodafone.com] for information :);;;",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

the issue is there is 2 records and 1 of them is in status sent to OM, so OGW think that the process is not done yet.
is it correct that we have 2 records that 1 is success and 1 is sent to om?
also, can you share here the om callback for this order?;;;","02/May/25 5:01 PM;nasir.sayyad@vodafone.com;HI Ran, Yes that is correct, currently we are having issues for DF Document for which we have opened a SPN Ticket again Output Management, But here for Normal document we are expecting OGW should send document to Omnius as it's stored in ACMS, Also Omnius is calling getdocument service with Document type P, so we are expecting OGW should not check for DF document as for DF document, Document type will be DF from Omnius with DF ID.;;;","02/May/25 5:12 PM;ran.farjun1@vodafone.com;what i mean is that we have 2 records with generate contract as SERVICE_MODE.
so when we are retriving the docs from this table: OGW_SEND_DOCUMENT_TRANSACTIONS, and we have STATUS parameter as sent to om, OGW is throwing an error.
we need to understand why we have success and also sent to OM record.

can you share the om callback request?

can you also share the generate contract request for the lates doc?;;;","02/May/25 8:42 PM;alka.kshirsagar2@vodafone.com;Hi Ran,

in this order we have order line with finance ban.
the issue is that we are sending 2 docs to OM with generate contract.
currently i can see that we got a response for only one of the record, that means status ""sent to om""
is still on one of the records in the OGW_SEND_DOCUMENT_TRANSACTIONS.
if that is the case we will throw an error because OGW think that doc is not ready, meaning we didnt get all the callbacks.

i need to check with my team if we need to get om callback for DF contract and regular contract from OM.
[~ajay.yashwantbhavar@vodafone.com]  can you also check with OM team? ;;;","05/May/25 11:15 AM;ajay.yashwantbhavar@vodafone.com;Hi [~ran.farjun1@vodafone.com]

I just checked and the BLES response looks fine. Also, there wasn't any BLES deployment since a whole week. So I'm pretty sure it has nothing to do with BLES.

!image-2025-04-22-16-44-54-078.png|width=667,height=375!;;;","22/Apr/25 4:48 PM;ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com;Feedback from Simon Auch:

TL;DR: The issue observed by OSF (no products visible in configurator) was caused by an infrastructure component of the kubernetes cluster BLES runs in, not by BLES.

Requests from Omnius and IBP to BLES both had the issue that sometimes the request was rejected with a ""401 unauthorized"" error, returned by an nginx.

The path of a request from IBP/Omnius to BLES looks roughly like:
 * IBP/Omnius
 * ConHub
 * NGinx
 * BLES

The credentials for all requests to BLES are checked by the nginx instance directly in front of it and, therefore, this was not an issue with BLES.

Since the nginx checks the credentials and 401 errors are related to authorization, I checked the nginx logs. There I found errors indicating that one of the nginx pods (the nginx deployment consists of 3 pods) ran out of disk space. I then checked which pod was out of disk space and killed it, causing Kubernetes to reschedule a new pod to replace it. This fixed the issue.

Follow up steps I see for the infrastructure Teams:
 * improve monitoring for the nginx deployments
 * figure out why this pod was not detected as unhealthy by kubernetes on its own and change it
 * try to find out why the disk was full in the first place
 * retrospectively:
 ** why was it determined to not be an infrastructure issue?
 ** raise awareness for the criticality of cloud components in the system teams;;;","22/Apr/25 5:01 PM;tanvi.bagade@vodafone.com;Issue resolved, therefore closing the ticket;;;",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Issue is reproducible on ACC but on ST or on local we have not direct service connect so we cannot recreate the same but we need to somehow manage to fix the same.

[~tasneem.sattar@vodafone.com]: could you pleaae run KIAS data sync in PAPS. (esp. table MMC_SOC_GROUP_RELATION is important here)

Perhaps this snapshot was even not refreshed recently on KIAS side. In fact, the snapshot REFSSDC450 used in KIAS test envs shows the relevant record. This inconsistency between PAPS data (synced KIAS table MNREFSS2.SOC_GROUP_RELATION) and KIAS test env refdata leads to the SOC plausibility failure in the KIAS backend.

Last update from KIAS Team:

Hello Andreas,

 

I think this is defined at OCCS side. Accordingly the Activation evaluation should populate.

Currently the values for External credit class and Rating reason code provided from OCCS are different than we expect in success case.

 

Current value: External credit class= X

 

Previous value: External credit class= A

 

[@Esraa Mansour, Vodafone|mailto:esraa.mansour1@vodafone.com]: Could you please check for the credit check responses sent from OCCS on INT/OPT environments.

 ;;;","22/Apr/25 4:44 PM;rohan.kumbhar@vodafone.com;as per KIAS/DXL analysis the issue seems to be related to DXL development :-

Kind regards, Andreas


DXL Comments:-
Thank you Andreas.

My understanding so far is that DXL is sending 

External credit class= X

Expected:

External credit class= A

While checking the DXL logs, I found the traceID: 05ebb2da234bfe33d84c9dfc85de89a1

DXL is really  sending 
                                               <ns2:additionalData>
                                                               <ns2:key>externalCreditClass</ns2:key>
                                                               <ns2:value>X</ns2:value>
                                               </ns2:additionalData>

This DXL request is following this schufa rating response:
### POST SOUTHBOUND REST RESPONSE URI:http://js-schufa-rating-adapter.dxl-argocd/checkCreditStandingForCustomer WITH STATUS [200] ### {""state"":""SUCCESS"",""infotext"":[""X- KI SCOREBEREICH I"",""ES LIEGEN KEINE DATEN AUS OEFFENTLICHEN VERZEICHNISSEN ODER ZU VERTRAGSWIDRIGEM VERHALTEN VOR""],""fraudPreCheck"":{""resultType"":""VERARBEITUNGSFEHLER"",""errorMessage"":[""{id:PLA0012, text:Feld muss gefüllt sein, detail:GP-Geschaeftsvorgangsreferenz}""]},""schufaReferenceId"":""50273634""}

I don’t know which is the business logic for having externalCreditClass set to “X” but if it is not related to the schufa-rating response, I suggest to create a bug ticket and assign it to DXL for a deeper analysis from the development team.

Regards,
Raniero

acc1 request: -> Sending request for service: cdhService
other stages: -> Sending request for service: CentralSearch

-> please investigate if there is a correlation between the actual defect and the service that is called on acc1 (cdhService instead of CentralSearch).

We are getting 400 Bad Requests from the CDH, even though we are providing all the required parameters. 

We need to ask the CDH team why we are receiving these 400 Bad Requests despite giving the necessary parameters.

 ;;;","10/Jun/25 12:30 AM;ajay.yashwantbhavar@vodafone.com;Issue is still reproducible, Atharva and Tanvi checking with CDH Team.;;;","11/Jun/25 3:21 PM;daniel.loos@vodafone.com;please be aware of the differences here in the request structure.
[~akhilesh.sawarkar@vodafone.com] the page you shared clearly shows that this request structure is expected:
(example with ID + firstname + lastname)
https://10.70.0.152:3213/api/solsticeCustomerSearch/v1/customer?id=1002123456789&givenName=test&familyName=user

We, on the other hand, are sending ALL parameters even though they are empty -> this is why the request is failing.

the question is for me:
1) Is there a conflict between the search services (cdhSearch vs CustomerSearch -> see logfile ""Sending request for service: cdhService""; according to [~shival.gupta1@vodafone.com] the request is being created corretly if the service is ""customerSearch"")

2) does OSF have to change their request structure?
3) does CDH have to change their request processing?;;;","12/Jun/25 9:31 PM;akhilesh.sawarkar@vodafone.com;Hi,

I spoke with Shival about the design.

We decided that agents will provide either below params
 * customer number →  *Customer* 
 * contract number→ *Agreement Id*
 * OSF order number  → {*}Product Order External Id{*}{*}{*}

or 
 * First Name
 * Last Name
 * City name
 * Streetname
 * House no.
 * House no. postfix
 * E-mail
 * date if birth

when searching in the customer.

When Omnius calls the CDH API to search customer, it will only send the parameters given in the frontend, ignoring any empty values in the request payload.

I believe Omnius should make these changes.;;;","12/Jun/25 9:44 PM;daniel.loos@vodafone.com;Hi [~akhilesh.sawarkar@vodafone.com], as you write:
""When Omnius calls the CDH API to search customer, it will only send the parameters given in the frontend, ignoring any empty values in the request payload.""

This is the expected behavior but also the reason why this defect ticket exists - because in SIT4 and ACC1 this is not the way it is happening (see also SOLDEFECT-17524).
An RCA what broke the customer search would be appreciated (side effect from php upgrade?) in parallel to a defect fix.

I found multiple problems with Jupiter-AQ on test2b after migration because a lot of Queues and Error-Queues are not working because Enque-/Dequeing is not enabled. 

Please check and fix it

 

Hello Anton Ustimenko, Vodafone, who can help with this issue, we will be block by OSF E2E completly .. 

 

why is enabling enqueing/dequeing not possible?

 

We can request Team Data/DBAs to check the queues in the DB. What queues are affected and when did the error appear?

 

I  don't want to do it for every queue. This is part of migration

Hi All,

SIT testing may take time due to environment and data set ready to test the improvement.
so to simplify it we will test in ST and share the result with Vodafone to 
also on the same time SIT test will also carryout with help of Amdocs so that once that is done we will send that SIT result as well.

By above process we can have test result for both ST and SIT. hopefully we can achieve SIT Test completion before 21/05 as well.

Environment : IT;;;","04/Apr/25 1:14 AM;rohan.kumbhar@vodafone.com;Dear All,

I did some analysis and found that the issue is with Tech M(added comments in defect also)—where they need to fix the correct value send in source system tag—as per design shall send only below values from below 
OSF.TCP,
OSF.TNC,
OSF.RCP,
OSF.RNC

As of now they are sending OSF.TOP which is related BEW settings flow

Issue is with Tech M-- where they are sending the wrong value <v1:SourceSystemID>OSF.TOP</v1:SourceSystemID> in Mode 3 call where OGW internally will call GetMaketingPermission towards FN system.

OSE/OIL --> OGW Mode 3 call via RetrieveCustomerInfo

Hi Satish,
 
The sourcesystemID is picked from communication_variable_reference table which is populated when importing Reference_CommunicationVariables PCAT file.

Hence check if the PCAT file is incorrect or if importing this file is creating a wrong data in table.

Just checked importing right file creates right data.

Steps to reproduce :

Permission to 360 view agent role : MTAN + SPIN_CAB or SPIN_MOB + 20FX authentication

1.Login to Omnius in Telesales/Ret channel (with 360 view agent role)
2.Search Existing Mobile  Private Postpaid customer
3.Verify Customer search result on search result page.
4. Authentication window will be displayed .
5.As DXL is down we will get 500 error in BE
6.If call is unsuccessful MTAN service sends MTAN to selected MSISDN and returns success code (500)
7.Directly 20FX window will appear to authenticate customer with an error code 

*Actual Result:* MTAN is not working due to Error 500, the next possible authentication should be shown for the agent, without any windows shown in between.

*Expected Result :* In case we get Error 500, the expectation is that agent can authenticate the customer via 2OFX

As per TechM, they haven't fixed the issue, and this defect is reported six months ago in March. I checked the same defect just two days back, and it was still unresolved.

However, today, it appears to be working correctly.

It seems that something might have been fixed in the latest delivery. Could you please suggest the best way to handle this defect.

Hi [~vishal.raut@vodafone.com] 
 
Checked the PCAT files - The Option for OneNumber does not have a sliding calculator value in the PCAT

The hardware selected is not a device financing hardware and hence does not have device_financing_duration value

That is why the end period is not sent towards OGW.

Request you to run a scenario with options and discounts which have Sliding Calculator values and a DF hardware added as well, select the DF tariff too.;;;","17/Feb/25 7:32 PM;nasir.sayyad@vodafone.com;Hello [~shruti.kanchan@vodafone.com] [~vikash.saurav@vodafone.com]

Actually DF Product setup is not available in ACC for New Activation and this test case we have executed with VoiceTariff and OneNumber option, So Is this current behavior is correct as per the implementation?

Below reply from Rob

One addition:
•	Techm will provide the fix for the defects.
Assuming the SubmitOrder Analysis shows, that the defect is indeed in Omnius.  (This is regarding the defect for not showing the valid period per SKU on the contract summary)
;;;","18/Feb/25 1:32 PM;vikash.saurav@vodafone.com;Shruti Kanchan added a comment - 
hi [~nasir.sayyad@vodafone.com] 
 
The sliding calculator will reflect when PCAT provides the same.

Example Hardware SKU - KSM2XSH05 used in this case is not a DF hardware and does not have Device_Financing_Duration so no End Period is captured for this SKU

SImilarly the OneNumber Option with SKU KONENUMBERrc1_5 does not have Sliding Calculator Value in the PCAT

Can see in the Retail & Telesales submit logs that Omnius is sending the agreed PhonebookEntryList for Erweitert/Abweichend PhoneBookentry option for both retail and telesales.

We do not have the option to access Z_INC02794732A001/ [https://de.jira.agile.vodafone.com/browse/DISHYBRID-5736]

custom-phonebook-data is not part of our design between Omnius (OIL) and OGW submit structure.

We’ll need a call to understand the custom-phonebook-data node information.

{code};;;","19/Feb/25 6:52 PM;ran.farjun1@vodafone.com;from the comments below we need to send the value: directory-assistance, currently i dont see OGW mapping for this.

 ;;;","26/Feb/25 12:51 PM;gaurav.lanjewar1@vodafone.com;Latest comment from Gaurab Mitra ( Amdocs ) :

1-I think this check should be other way , from Prod we need to find order with such configurations where we are sending custom-phonebook-data tag (main tag) under that directory-assistance (sub tag) is appearing as mandatory in ACC. 

2- If we are able to send main tag without the sub tag today in prod , then we have to assume this is due to recent changes in Tivano. We need to check with them first and design it accordingly.

Hello [~pallavi.kokate1@vodafone.com] 

this is not a valid defect. it works as expected.

for billing address dropdown,

there is customer known billing address shown over UI option that received from Customer Ibase, with fixed label *Vorhandene Adresse verwenden* ( address details) and this data shown as readonly mode also dropdown is also in readonly state when validation pass successfully,

if case validation fails then force to choose different address then dropdown state editable and user choose another option from dropdown.

Regards to customer known billing address under summary section system shown the exact Billing data (Contact+Address) as it received from Customer Ibase. 
we found in GetCustomerDetails Mode-1 there is not title data received for billing contact, that is why title info in not shown over summary UI.

mainly it was agreed not to change customer known billing details (contact & Address) in Omnius when Billing data (Contact+Address) are correct. And for that reason in first place it shown in readonly state.;;;","19/Mar/25 11:45 AM;pallavi.kokate1@vodafone.com;Checking with data (D2C customer ) which is already having title in name ;;;","08/Apr/25 5:47 PM;ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com;[~pallavi.kokate1@vodafone.com]  any update on this ticket?;;;","10/Apr/25 4:28 PM;ajay.yashwantbhavar@vodafone.com;[~pallavi.kokate1@vodafone.com] [~sneha.wayal1@vodafone.com] Can you please check and update this ticket.;;;","15/Apr/25 12:18 PM;pallavi.kokate1@vodafone.com;With Data having already billing address its working fine

Hi All,

Discussed with Dev on this and as per them it is not an issue or software bug as such. It is a process or design gap that need to clear with senior dev for which we will schedule a call with Senior dev and update further with their comments.

Issue has been discussed with bas and we come to solution, which is as below.

During the populate_additionalDb step we are thinking to update the catalog_tables.xml file as like we do during the resetModule upgrade process.

This should make the update similar and should solve our problem currently we are facing.

 

This change or fix cannot be fixed immediately as it needs quite development and more testing effort after the fix, as we don't have such env setup like ACC where we have separate Web & Script servers maintained. Also this issue should be part of the PROD aswell, may be its not observed on PROD or this feature never used in PROD.

Can you check and share this information if *populate_additionalDb.php* step is ever performed on PROD PLM process?;;;","23/Jan/25 5:22 PM;ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com;[~vikash.saurav@vodafone.com]  yes we are performing this step each night in the regular publish process;;;","27/Jan/25 11:26 AM;vikash.saurav@vodafone.com;Requested Tech M Production team to schedule call with VF OPS to check this on PROD;;;","29/Jan/25 12:03 PM;vikash.saurav@vodafone.com;SunilkumarCM added a comment
 
 
Hi All

I discussed this issue further with Waseem and discussed few possible solution.

Solution: we need to keep the *catalog_tables.xml* file on some central place and create symlink of it on all servers like Web servers, Script Servers, API servers, to avoid file differences between Web & Script servers, etc

Ideally it should be treated/managed to create symlink similar to the Cable artifact file we currently do after pcat import.

*Steps to follow to create symlink.*
 # Ideally we need to perform this Symlink create after the completion of PCAT import on Sandbox environment.

 # Then copy the file from Sandbox environment from the path \{{DOCROOT}}/app/etc/catalog_tables.xml and keep it on some central place

*Note: This copy file and create symlink should happen before we start the Publish activity.(Ideally after completion of PCAT import and before Publish start)*
 # Then start the publish process.

We need to discuss  so that this can be done on ACC and verified. KIndly schedule call for the same;;;","31/Jan/25 12:46 PM;atharva.paskanthi@vodafone.com;Call is scheduled today with TID Team;;;","31/Jan/25 4:58 PM;atharva.paskanthi@vodafone.com;*OSF | Wave9.2 | Checkpoint | DM | OS-65820 MoM and Action items (31st January, 2025)*

TechM is working on a solution from code and infra side, but its not mandatory for production Go Live Wave 9.2 as issue is already present in production and temporarily solved. Unless no new package type will come up, it should not fail anymore.

Issue is caused by the solution for faster PCAT Publish (reduction of the publish downtime). Within this solution there is a design gap

reset modules are running on the application but its getting updated on Webservers only -> files on the script servers are not updated. There is a configuration in backend to connect to Webserver or Scriptserver and for security reasons we need to get the files from Scriptservers and cannot take it from Webservers

*Issue:*

This issue occurred due to mismatch in table on Sandbox and script server. The mismatch happened because “catalog_tables.xml” update on sandboxes is not reflected on other server.

 

{*}Solution{*}:

As part of this solution  we create a Symlink of  “catalog_tables.xml” and put in a central location so that  central location has always have updated   file of  “catalog_tables.xml”, whenever deployment will happen on other server it will pick this file “catalog_tables.xml”  from  central location  and not from pkg itself  so that other server will have  Web, Script & API etc will have updated file as well  so that when plm run from script server it will not  have mismatch of table issue  due to updated file there.

Based on the latest call below is the solution:

OSE deployment on Sandbox:
 # Check if catalog_tables.xml is present under the shared location (for example in ACC1: /opt/SP/websync/PRD_DATA/omnius/ACC1/catalogue/)
 # IF file is present, then create a symlink for the file in app/etc/catalog_tables.xml towards sharedpath/catalog_tables.xml for example in ACC1: /opt/SP/WEB_DATA/ACC1/omnius/osf-dintib-acc1/app/etc/catalog_tables.xml is symlinked to /opt/SP/websync/PRD_DATA/omnius/ACC1/catalogue/catalog_tables.xml file.
 # IF file is not present then COPY the catalog_tables.xml file from the tar package to the shared location (for example in ACC1 on the location /opt/SP/websync/PRD_DATA/omnius/ACC1/catalogue/catalog_tables.xml) and then create a symlink same as step 2.
 # *Either step 2 is taken or step 3, app/etc/catalog_tables.xml file should always be a symlink to the sharedlocation/catalog_tables.xml file at the end of SANDBOX deployment.*

OSE deployment on webser, api server, script server or any deployment other than SANDBOX deployment.
 # Create a symlink for the file app/etc/catalog_tables.xml to the file present in the sharedlocation/catalog_tables.xml. For example on ACC1 the file /opt/SP/WEB_DATA/ACC1/omnius/osf-telesales-int-acc1/app/etc/catalog_tables.xml is symlinked to /opt/SP/websync/PRD_DATA/omnius/ACC1/catalogue/catalog_tables.xml file

This will ensure that the changes done to catalog_tables.xml during PLM is also available in the webserver or script or api as the change is done to the file on the sharedlocation.

For *other components* there is a refComponentId, e. g.:

Hi Natasa ,

From the error message mentioned above it is clear that some of the backend connectivity between OGW and actual backend is timeout or may be between systems which comes after OGW facing some timeout issues. This has to be verified by the actual backend system where we received the above error.
 
 {{Title : Weblogic Bridge Message, Message = Failure of Web Server bridge:No backend server available for connection: timed out after 10 seconds or idempotent set to OFF or method not idempotent.}}
This is not error on OSE or the OIL system.;;;","11/Oct/24 4:29 PM;natasa.dimovic1@vodafone.com;Hi [~anton.ustimenko@vodafone.com], could you please ask a Cable developer to check this issue? Thank you;;;","11/Oct/24 4:46 PM;anton.ustimenko@vodafone.com;[~natasa.dimovic1@vodafone.com] , [~bharath.krishnamurthy@vodafone.com] is this error reproducable? the error message with weblogic pointed out that some of the servers was down.

Here would be good to see the submitOrder request/response from log to find out which service call is went into this error.

As discussed.

In Omnius, companyname input field was introduced in wave1 with length restriction 30 chars

And after there was nothing change in restriction. also not requested to change in SOHO business epic. So its working as agreed design.

So, conclusion is its not a defect.

If it's needed to change then it must be change via new demand or CR to design and analyzed the impacted system.;;;","19/Sep/24 3:11 PM;natasa.dimovic1@vodafone.com;Hi [~thorsten.lehnert@vodafone.com] could you please check if a new CR is needed for this issue?

Due to this issue, VKD system is adding FIRMA as a salutation for this request in backend but When customer is activated in backend and agent tries to perform in-life sales flow on same customer, Omnius asking to select value for salutation field.

As discussed - Omnius is having only Mr & Mrs values for Cable SOHO customer in checkout & VKD backend is having only FIRMA value for salutation in backend for Legal customer.

i dont understand, which service is not working from OGW?

can you please explain?

also not sure what is this test data: 281507501
its not ogwOrderId and not Omnius order id;;;","01/Jul/24 4:35 PM;ran.farjun1@vodafone.com;Hi,

after the call today we can see that the flow is on standBy because no customer id is sent to ogw.
when customer id is being sent, OGW is triggering SetPermission request as expected;;;","01/Jul/24 7:04 PM;rohan.kumbhar@vodafone.com;

 !cable_minerva logs.png|thumbnail! 

Checked OSE/OGW calls where correct BEW update version with customer id is sent at UM backend where in Cable logs we see the request getting sent to UM via Minerva asking to update Version 4-- but somehow it seems UM is not updating Version 4 at their end - PFA SS for reference
For detail analysis check we need UM team support to check for this issue;;;","02/Jul/24 3:14 PM;rohan.kumbhar@vodafone.com; !screenshot-1.png|thumbnail! 

Tried new order for BEW with below details --same issue that from backend OSF is not getting the correct updated version as 4 in getcustomer details due to which the button is enabled for Unity media flow
customer id:953464201
documentID: 10875779;;;","03/Jul/24 12:53 AM;rohan.kumbhar@vodafone.com;here we see issue from Minerva adapter -- email sent to UM team to check on this issue 
;;;","04/Jul/24 6:28 PM;rohan.kumbhar@vodafone.com;As per the latest call on BEW topic.. there is a design GAP for the BEW flows which needs to be discussed by VF Design team.
as of now the problem here for this flow is that in the GetCustomerDetails Mode 3 call Omnius is always receiving BEWVersion as ""0"" irrespective of any other version is sent from OSF. So there is no checks nor validation of this BEW version at legacy backend and everytime Cable/UM will send Version 0 only.
So this is a design gap and currently this defect needs to be kept ON_HOLD until further clarification;;;","09/Jul/24 3:00 PM;ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com;[~rohan.kumbhar@vodafone.com]  who is taking this point now to discuss about unitymedia?
As its not only BEW only Retail which is not wroking, but also not for Telesales new customers in case its not IPCC triggered, and Retail new customers have never been tested.

So a general discussion is required?;;;","11/Jul/24 7:56 PM;ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com;[~rohan.kumbhar@vodafone.com]  based on the latest calls e have the following findings for Retail BEW and unitymedia in general

1) New customer, Retail, order + BEW -> Backend receives and stores BEW correctly

2) Existing customer, Retail, order + BEW -> Backend receives and stores BEW correctly

3) Existing customer, Retail, BEW only ->{color:#de350b} *Backend receives and stores BEW correctly? Please confirm this*
{color:#172b4d}What is wrong in all cases -> Frontend OSF is not able to retrieve the right BEW settings. So if BEW was updated in UNitymedia backend, Frontend is not reflecting this. It still looks like no BEW is set{color} ** 
{color:#172b4d}We will also compare the same for VKD, how Retrievecustomerinfo Mode 3 related to BEW permissions is looking like{color}{color};;;","12/Jul/24 3:20 PM;rohan.kumbhar@vodafone.com;As per latest observation it seems that Problem is happening only for the Unity Media customers when they chose BEW Options.
We tried 1 Cable New acquisition where BEW were correctly updated at backend and then we tried to fetch the same customer on OSF portal where correct Version status was reflected in GetCustomerDetails call and also BEW Button was disabled.

;;;","12/Jul/24 7:08 PM;ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com;[~rohan.kumbhar@vodafone.com]  the ticket itself is only for Unitymedia, so for VKD its not a problem and no ticket reported.

We still need to document here, if the Existing customer, Retail, BEW only for Unitymedia is reaching the backend as ticket says 

_*{color:#de350b}BEW version is not updating in Unity Backend{color}* and BEW Erfassen is enable even after update the version._

 

At the moment we assume, BEW version is getting updated in Unity backend, but we cannot retrieve the GetPermissions because its not giving back the correct version 
Unitymedia is handling permissions with Version 2, OGW expecting Version  4 and for retrieval of existing permissions we get Version 0.

Needs to be checked with responsible person from MinervaAdapter (VKD side);;;","17/Jul/24 2:34 PM;ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com;No progress yet as we did not identify the responsible person who can help with Minerva Adapter VKD ;;;","18/Jul/24 9:28 PM;ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com;I have enclosed the latest discussion.
As per latest analysis this problem is related to the way back from Unitymedia via Minerva Adapter VKD to OGW

{color:#de350b}*OK:*{color} OGW version 4 -> Minerva Adapter maps Version 4 from the VKD request into Version 2 for the request to UME/VFW -> UME/VFW is storing Version 2 correctly in Mood and showing right entries in RNS for the customer 

{color:#00875a}*Not OK*{color}: Now when we open the customer who has given BEW again in OSF, we expect that the stored BEW is taken and we are not asked to capture BEW again. Problem: For this get_permission Call we are receiving version 0 for the mentioned scenarios and we cannot map this version to our valid Version 4 (not OK)

{+}*Gap*{+}: We need a Mapping: UME/VFW is sending back Version 2 to Minerva Adapter-> Minerva Adapter maps Version 2 to Version 4 if getpermission request is coming from OGW

 

I have shared the feedback also with Jörg Trierweiler, Thomas Schneider, Andreas Baldermann and few more people to verify.
This is a general topic and not specifically related to BEW only Retail Epic
Waiting for feedback about possible next steps;;;","11/Aug/24 5:06 PM;ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com;I did not receive an answer yet from the experts how to handle this defect. However, I remind them again (Due to vacation might need some time until they reply).

Thank you;;;","07/Feb/24 4:40 PM;natasa.dimovic1@vodafone.com;Hi [~vikash.saurav@vodafone.com] the customer 934800577 is a VKD KUD customer, but on a Unity Media address. This seems to be the issue

This is the answer from Raniero:

You need to check with OSF, this is what OSF is sending:
and OSF is sending a request for an UM customer (BW = Baden Württenberg).

This is a urn for a VKD customer:

!image-2024-02-07-12-08-44-486.png!

This is a urn for a UM customer:

!image-2024-02-07-12-09-00-539.png!

In SoapUI you are sending a request for a VKD customer, OSF sends a request for an UM customer.

Could you please check that again? Thanks;;;","07/Feb/24 5:33 PM;vikash.saurav@vodafone.com;Divya Kumbla added a comment -
 
 
Hi [~natasa.dimovic1@vodafone.com]  ,Again the decision of whether the customer is VKD or UM is based on AccountCategory in getCustomerResult for index search

and Region in retrieveCustomerInfo mode1 for Legacysearch.

For reference

!image-2024-02-07-17-32-45-292.png!

So we need to check what is coming for this customer for which you need to share the search response and mode1 response logs.;;;","07/Feb/24 6:06 PM;natasa.dimovic1@vodafone.com;Hi [~vikash.saurav@vodafone.com] please find attached the logs;;;","08/Feb/24 1:12 PM;vikash.saurav@vodafone.com;Divya Kumbla added a comment -
 
Hi [~natasa.dimovic1@vodafone.com] 

As said earlier the region from mode1 decides if its VKD or UM, and as per attached logs we receive region as UME-KBW hence OSE considers it as UM customer.

 * Values like ""AccountCategory"" in Omnius are derived from OGW: Here:- _AccountCategory_ in getCustomerResult for index search and _Region_ in retrieveCustomerInfo mode1 for LegacySearch.
 * As the ADDRESS REGION is in UM Area - it is treated as UM customer, even though he belongs to the VKD Stack

h4. _Possible SD option to be validated/proven:_ 
 * Derive customer stack from GlobalID prefix (""legacy stack"")  instead of address region
 * IF improvements required as this is only known by OGW (Omnius can only see LK_ from linked customers) - e.g. introducing new attribute to indicate customers product stack:
 * CustomerSearch()
 * getCustomerDetails()
 * [@Mitra, Gaurab, External Vendor|mailto:gaurab.mitra@amdocs.com]: We should investigate if further interfaces have to be considered (To be discussed on next CR meeting)

[@Kshitij.Srivastava@comviva.com|mailto:kshitij.srivastava@comviva.com]: To check UseCases in Omnius to be considered for an improvement

Further benefit: Omnius Performance increase If product stack information is directly provided by OGW

Hi [~ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com]  ,

I don't see the steps to reproduce and if its for existing customer we need mode logs and serviceability logs between OSE<->OIL & OIL<->OGW.

Thanks

[~alka.kshirsagar2@vodafone.com] fyi;;;","24/Jan/24 3:56 PM;ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com;[~vikash.saurav@vodafone.com]  I was not creating any order, I am just scanning portal UI tool from time to time to find unidentified issues. And within this quality check I have found tickets with this error message. 

 

After some analysis I have identified, that it seems to be this scenario:

-> Search existing unitymedia customer and perform Move to VKD adress 

 

this is example Order ID from ACC1 - it failed with 2 sky tickets

One ticket because of invalid VPKN (issue is solved, please ignore that) and second sky ticket was for setpermission.


Unfortunately Sky ticket were cleared in between so I am not able to find my two tickets anymore..... But hopefully you can reproduce on your environment for a Move from Unity to VKD.

Seems like in this case the existing customer ID from unity is taken over, instead of recognizing that customer will get a new customer ID from VKD for Move scenario

 

Order ID 782545, Customer ID 1009755201 (initial customer before Move) 

!image-2024-01-24-11-21-17-927.png!

 

Same seems to happen when moving from Unity Cable to DSL product. 

So please check flow Unity Cable to VKD Cable Move, and Unity Cable to DSL Move

 ;;;","25/Jan/24 5:24 PM;ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com;We have placed another order yesterday.

*Move from Unity Cable to VKD Cable* with permission selection in checkout.
Omnius Order ID 783467

 

In SetPermission Call I see that its called for Cable - {*}UN{*}, but the target customer is VKD Customer after Move. 



So I would expect in the setpermission call that system is calling VKD with new VKD customer ID, right? It does not make sense to store a permission in unitymedia backend when the customer is going to be inactive there, and will be active only in VKD in the future with new customer ID

Hi [~ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com]  ,

Further based on investigation above is the expected behavior. Which means for the existing customer we are getting the region value from Install Base and if region value which is from the IB or from the serviceability(in ACQ) is not matching with the below table data which is agreed during the design, then OSE send empty <CustomerList><CustomerDetails>{*}<TargetSystem>{*}.

If for any new region value VF expects to send *TargetSystem* value then it has to be added to OSE via SRT

I double checked in our logs and attached them here as well (cable rules artifact logs), maybe they help.
The scenario I clicked was:
 * load existing KIP customer
 * open kip package
 * open (new) mobile package
 * select any bundle eligible mobile tariff -> bundle drawer pops up
 * create the bundle by clicking the bundle drawer
 * go to checkout -> see message
 * logs of this state: [^cable_rules_artifact_OS47914_pre_workaround.log]
 * open kip package
 * select any option and deselect it again
 * logs of this state:
[^cable_rules_artifact_OS47914_post_workaround.log]

When checking the logs notice that no posting rules are executed after the bundle is created and before the workaround is applied.

Hi Alexander/Simon,

This is not a code issue I have checked working PCAT with the ACC1/ACC2 codebase in my local environment and it's working fine, seems something wrong with the ACC2 PCAT.

I have checked Rules manager and some differences found in the rules also in both the PCAT's so both PCT’s are not same.

*ACC1:*
Total Rules: 73185 
Mobile: 62760
KIP Ruls: 5168
KABLE TV Rules: 4450

*ACC2:*

The problem is, that ACC2 is having January catalogue since today, as PST is testing next release. So maybe first of all the issue has to be reproducable with new catalogue. Maybe we have to bring PST Team and TechM together to get it clarified ;;;","11/Dec/23 6:53 PM;simon.auch@vodafone.com;[~bharath.krishnamurthy@vodafone.com]  could you please in detail explain what you tested?

 ;;;","13/Dec/23 4:42 PM;simon.auch@vodafone.com;As explained in the call (and in previous comments on this ticket):

Hi Alexander/Simon,
 
 For extended shopping cart min max equal warning rules, there is not relation with cable post rule results or execution.
The rule which is problematic, is a max(0) rule and service to category rule. So if this rule’s service source expression evaluates to true than it will check if cart have max 0 number of products only from the target category. So if product OMNIUSTVCHANGEDMARKER is not part of the package then problematic rule service source expression will evaluate to true and further it will show warning if from target category we have more then 0 products in cart.;;;","14/Dec/23 2:55 PM;simon.auch@vodafone.com;Hi [~bharath.krishnamurthy@vodafone.com],

the relation is implicit, the posting rules select the OMNIUSTVCHANGEDMARKER once there is any change to the package. OSF needs to call the posting rules after any change to cable packages including bundle rules.

*OSF has to call the posting rules after any change to a cable package, otherwise inconsistencies regarding products/orders/etc are to be expected.* ;;;","14/Dec/23 3:30 PM;ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com;[~simon.auch@vodafone.com]  is there any story about this behavior ""{*}OSF has to call the posting rules after any change to a cable package, otherwise inconsistencies regarding products/orders/etc are to be expected.{*} "" so we can see that it was exactly requested in this way from OSF Software?;;;","14/Dec/23 3:30 PM;bharath.krishnamurthy@vodafone.com;[~johannes-alexander.dengler@vodafone.com] [~simon.auch@vodafone.com]

Hi Alexander/Simon,
 
The logic implemented long back cannot be modified as it may cause additional adversary problems. However, if you require this logic to be changed, it will require the involvement of design team.;;;","14/Dec/23 4:54 PM;simon.auch@vodafone.com;[~ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com], I am not sure if there was any more specific documentation (I will keep searching for a bit), but the following HLD already has a section:
|*Cable artifact rules*
 
The Cable Catalog and PLM colleagues have requested their own rules engine to be applied in the configurator. This is realised with a plugin development where Cable colleagues can upload their Rules Artifact as part of the PLM process. This Rules Artifact consists of the same Sales Rules (in PHP language/cable-speak) that is used currently in ECC front-ends. OMNIUS will share the full-shoppingcart (all packages) to the Rules Artifact, the rules artifact will process ruling, and return the shoppingcart object with modified cable orderlines in Kabel TV, KIP and KUD packages to be displayed in OMNIUS. The Rules Artifact will be called both before a product is selected (on show of configurator, pre-condition) {*}as well as after selecting a product (on adding to the shoppingcart, post-condition){*}. OMNIUS will not be able to have special GUI handling like for internal OMNIUS sales rules when using the Artifact.|

Highlighting added by me.

From a slightly newer HLD:
|Apart from the Omnius compatibility rules for cable, specific precondition and postcondition rules from cable are also evaluated within the Cable Rules Artifact. *With each change in the configurator (for cable products) the Omnius rules and Cable rules artifact are evaluated in a loop, until a stable state is reached.* |

Hi Ari,

Need inputs from Simon on this.;;;","05/Jan/24 4:31 PM;frederik.finckh@vodafone.com;Hi all, I have tried to reproduce this bug again, and verified once again that what Simon wrote in this comment is still true. I think it really comes down to the posting rules not being executed after the bundle rules changed the selection.
{quote}Simon Auch, Vodafone (External) added a comment - 13/Dec/23 12:12 PM

As explained in the call (and in previous comments on this ticket):

the checkout is blocked by a rule that comes from the pcat because the product OMNIUSTVCHANGEDMARKER is not selected.
the product is added by the posting rules of the cable rules artifact if there is any change to the TV package
after the bundle is created the TV package is changed as it now contains VB4
as checked in the logs: the posting rules are not called by OSF after the bundle is created

OSF has to call the posting rules after any change to a cable package, otherwise inconsistencies regarding products/orders/etc are to be expected.

Ideally a third value 2 will be reported meaning ""no PCAT changes / no import"", please sync with operations on interpretation. - Minimum would be not reporting failure.
