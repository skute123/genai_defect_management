Hi Taher ,

Based on further analysis we have found that the ACC3 DB is missing some reference serviceability data, which needs to be correct and this issue can be verified.

Eugen has provided API which is configured in test3b ""https://wss-anypoint-test.web-vkd.de.vodafone.com/minerva-http-proxy/minerva/WebSelfCareService""

As par of the flow below things are working fine 
1. Automatic load of UM data to OGG database
2. Correct tables are getting updated in OGW
3. incremental OGG index file is getting processed and created in ACC servers with the newly or updated data
4. data which is available in Index/updatefile  -- able to search on Fronend

Current issue-: 360 degree not working due to data problem. Customer identification list has been shared with Gopala where he will confirm us on the active  valid UAT10  present customers.;;;","26/Aug/24 6:42 PM;petros.dimitriou@vodafone.com;Hi all,

Hi Ariadne It is working fine in ACC2 . So can we move this defect to ACC2 and close ? or do we need to keep it in ACC3 only ?
{quote}
we can move it to ACC2 and close it with retest on ACC2. 

 

the catalogue which we received on ACC3 mid of last week will not reach any test environment anymore so probably issue should not happen again

we are getting the subscriber number for every orderLine but the problem is we are getting the set order status in the same second:

because of this the CDM is not getting update correctly and 1 of the orderLine missing the subscriber number, and if this is missing the Marsh file will not be created for that order line.

this is the timepStamp from the set order status:

the generation of the Marsh File for SOHO Firma is 'technically' from OGW side not possible.

My understanding was that therefore it should not be possible in OSF to order the insurance options Cover/Cover Plus for customer type=SoHo Firma.

 

The Insurance Option are still shown on ACC2 for customer type SOHO Firma, can you pls check:

The Logic which handset insurance could be booked for SOHO is based on the tariffs. So for enterprise tariffs the cover socs are not allowed.

Also for legacy insurance 24HATAV23 and the old Cover Plus SOCs CO3* no rule exists to restrict them based on customer type.

ok, with this ACC Bug, once the SW is delivered we can retest that for 'Companies without RV' the Marsh File is generated.

 

Here is the content of the new story.

Note: These new changes are not scoped for testing by ACC Team, only the ACC Bug will be retested.

 

'The new Vodafone Cover and Cover Plus SOCs introduced with CR791 shall be exclusively available for consumer users. Business users are excluded and shall not be able to book these SOCs.

The following SOCs shall only be bookable by consumer users (Private consumers, SOHO without RV, Companies without RV) and shall +not+ be bookable by business users (SOHO with RV, Companies with RV):

i need the request you sent in WS for createDoc service, like the BEWzip file you attach earlier.
there is no need in WF logs, only ws.

can you also attach getDocument request from oMnius to OGW.

also, was the OMcallback was successful? 
regarding my question: are you referring that Omnius is not sending ADVIndicator or DEVIndicator?
if yes can you please attach the request?
in the request that was attach i can see that DEVIndicator and ADVIndicator are present;;;","21/May/24 5:15 PM;sneha.wayal1@vodafone.com;Hi Ran,

can you please check if OM sent any callback regarding this request?;;;","21/May/24 7:43 PM;sneha.wayal1@vodafone.com;Hi Rohan,

Could you please check on below.

We have send mail to TEMS Team for OM logs.;;;","22/May/24 4:15 PM;rohan.kumbhar@vodafone.com;Checked with TEMs, OGW team --as per analysis-- OGW is sending SendDocumentRequest to OM and OM is sending back the response for it.
But now to enable  document retrieval on portal-- OGW shall receive SendDocumentOmCallBackRequest API from OM where in this request they shall have the Base64 document format . So currently OGW is missing this requestf from OM.

Email sent to OM development team to check on the issue;;;","23/May/24 1:56 PM;rohan.kumbhar@vodafone.com;As of now for the BEWOnly – functionality related to SendDocument call we have an issue with Router call back call where due to which we are not able to get a call towards ACC2.

So, we need your help to change the configuration as per below for the SBUS(PR) env 

Current Callback Config in PR: https://osf-otype1-01-acc1.vodafone.de:8091/OMSendDocumentCallbackRouter/VFDE?WSDL

To be changed Config in PR:   https://osf-otype1-01-acc2.vodafone.de:8191/OMSendDocumentCallback/VFDE?WSDL

Basically, we need to make 1-1 config for the SendDocumentCallback call for the PR env.

[~gokul.vade@vodafone.com]  [~ajay.bhavar@vodafone.com]

this ACC tracking Bug can now be retestet on ACC1 with the *+2nd scenario+* ->{+}{+}no Insurance option should be visible(see description below)

Existing customers on ACC1 they can be used for the retest:
|Customer ID|Subscriber Number|Tariff Option|SOC|
|104724208|GSM1738852612|GM1LH30 |24HATAV17|

im trying to understand from which location OGW is getting this value.
is  the MSISDN is the subscriberNumber?

we can check if the number is in that request or coming from somewhere else.

also, is there a US for OGW that is saying that OGW need to remove 0?;;;","09/May/24 1:25 PM;krishnkumar.satpute@vodafone.com;Hi Ran

OGW is not manipulating the number, in the code, whatever the subscriber number that what will be in the marsh file.
there is no logic to check if the number start with 0.

is there any requirement and documentation for OGW to remove the 0?

Hi [~krishnkumar.satpute@vodafone.com] 
I see this use case where there is no hardware selected ( Mobile Hardware) in the screenshot.

Also there is no change for IMEI. IMEI should be captured manually either cart contains HW or NO HW. It has no relation with HW / tariff. This field has to be captured for both type of insurance products VODAFONE_COVER and VODAFONE_COVER_PLUS

Artikel Number for both insurance product (VODAFONE_COVER and VODAFONE_COVER_PLUS) is clearly stated in Userstory that ,
if the cart does not have Mobile HW then Artikel number field will be editable ( ie. it should be added manually ) & vice versa ( ie. if there is Mobile HW in the cart then Artikel number is pre-filled)

 This should happen with an valid german IBAN as well, but it is not clear why this was implemented like this and if there was a communication issue or not . If there was, we need clear specifications on how this should work exactly and the different cases so we can implement an appropriate fix.

Hi Harsha,
 
If the KUD product is not part of cable_app_de category then this check will not be shown and the agent is able to continue, otherwise this check will be shown and the agent will not be able to continue
 * In case of telesales, if sepa is true, then this check will be shown and the flow is blocked → agent is not able to continue

For further clarifications, you can check the original story :

https://jira.sp.vodafone.com/browse/OAF-179

OMNIUS : CHCK, As an agent i am allowed to proceed sales flow for cable package with mandatory residence check when SEPA is known, So that Agent can proceed next.;;;","26/Jul/23 10:53 AM;singireddy.reddy@vodafone.com;Will discuss with ari.;;;","15/Aug/23 8:40 PM;ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com;I still do not get it.

The story says: As an agent i am allowed to proceed sales flow for cable package with mandatory residence check when SEPA is known

-> In our example, SEPA Is known - but we are blocked and NOT able to proceed.
-> we are NOT using foreign IBAN

Something is wrong relate to the logic when we do not enter the IBAN itself but bank account and sort code !!
its only allowed for german bank data to use this option to enter bank account and sort code instead of IBAN

Hi Harsha/Ari,

This was clear from the beginning, yes, but as I mentioned, the implementation was intended to be like this :

*In case of telesales, if sepa is true, then this check will be shown and the flow is blocked → agent is not able to continue*

Which means that it does *NOT* matter _what IBAN is used_ , this will be shown if the sepa is true and *If the KUD product is part of cable_app_de category .* 

I agree that the way this is working is not consistent : in one case the agent is able to continue but in another the agent is not able to continue.

The final question is - when should the agent be able to continue the checkout process and when should the agent be blocked? According to the initial documentation the agent should not be able to continue and according to these comments the agent should be able to continue .

What is the purpose of this error message and what was wrongly implemented exactly? We can implement a fix according to these comments but we need to know if the issue is that the whole implementation was not done correctly or not, in order to fix the actual issue and not just a particular case .;;;","17/Aug/23 4:38 PM;ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com;The pop up says its not allowed to continue b{*}ecause of a foreign bank account or/ and different bank account holder{*}.

Hi Srujana ,

 

Firstly this is not error its feature. Check the below attached details which explains when and how the SEPA validation works. In the above case you can validate the same by getting *GetCablePayerAndPaymentInfo* details.

PFA

If you have any queries regarding this could you please schedule a call to conclude on expected behavior or please create new ticket for latest observation.;;;","08/Feb/24 1:37 PM;ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com;[~bharath.krishnamurthy@vodafone.com]  I am sorry but its not about a feature which should work in this way and we are running into circles all the time.

everything was properly explained and understood by Kshitik.

 

Please translate the error message into english! Its an error message that we are not allowed to go ahead because of foreign customer, or different bank account adress.

We are NOT using foreign adress or foreign IBAN here. We are also NOT using different bank account adress. 

We do not want to repeat the discussion again and again, please get in touch in Kshitij

 

You have to use the entry bank account number and sort code to enter it manually, then system is creating IBAN on its own automatically. 

If same IBAN would be typed in directly it works. Its about the functionality of using sort code and bank account number field;;;","12/Feb/24 3:47 PM;atharva.paskanthi@vodafone.com;Hello [~vikash.saurav@vodafone.com] , [~bharath.krishnamurthy@vodafone.com] , Can you please check the latest comment and provide update;;;","13/Feb/24 12:58 PM;atharva.paskanthi@vodafone.com;Comment from [~vikash.saurav@vodafone.com] :

Call scheduled Tomorrow with BA and dev regarding this defect;;;","23/Feb/24 10:36 AM;devi.jampana@vodafone.com;Hi All,

MOM Of yesterdays call:

We had a discussion with Sunil, Bharath and Kshitij

We tried to place the orders in both the ways

i.e with Filling the IBAN directly and also by giving the account number and sort code details 

And we received the same error in both the ways and we checked the response in logs (ValidateIBAN and GetPayerandPaymentInfo ) and observed that customer details are not retrieved in the response as the IBAN provided are invalid IBANS

 

But We have also tried with the Correct German IBANS(Below are the IBANS Used) and still we received the same error (I.e IBAN is not german)

DE10600501010006622066

DE02120300000000202051

DE21200505500001183151,  DE69200505500001083153 (These 2 IBANS has always  worked with KUD Orders previously)

For these 4 IBANS we have checked the Logs (VlaidateIBAN and GetPayerandPaymentInfo ) and we recieved the correct response( i.e Customer details are visible on the Response and also SEPA is showing as true )

*But still we received error in front end*

Hi [~devi.jampana@vodafone.com]

We have analyzed further and found that there is recent requirement over (https://jira.sp.vodafone.com/browse/OAF-690) [!https://bmcomviva.atlassian.net/images/icons/issuetypes/epic.svg!VFDED1FTS-5531: CR780 - Change of payment validation check for existing SEPA mandatIN DESIGN|https://bmcomviva.atlassian.net/browse/VFDED1FTS-5531] which is now available as part of the software where we are testing the above scenario.

As part the requirement we are now showing NOTIFICATION MODAL and disable ""Weiter"" button of payment section if the scenario we are performing meets below conditions.

System will validate if payment method = ""direct debit""
 * if yes: system will validate if IBAN = DE-IBAN

 ** if yes: system will validate if bank account owner (payer contact) = legal contact

 *** if yes: the system will validate if the bank account owner address (payer address) = legal address

 **** if yes: the system switches to the next checkout section

 *** if no: SHOW NOTIFICATION MODAL and disable ""Weiter"" button

 ** if no: SHOW NOTIFICATION MODAL and disable ""Weiter"" button

 * if no: SHOW NOTIFICATION MODAL and disable ""Weiter"" button.

Then we retry OS-37304 again

Hi Gaurav,

For the blank data or no PayerAndPaymentInfo response issue +OS-52308+ /VFDEW82E2E-94 is handle via improvement ticket. ref +OAF-744+ VFDED1FTS-5844

 

this the ticket description and comment says issue (open issue is with when agent capture bank details (Bank account number 1241111    Sort Code 70050000)) was fixed with new version of code

Please schedule a meeting to discuss with ACC team. this looks to me 2 issues are mix in one ticket;;;","23/Apr/24 7:29 PM;ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com;[~bharath.krishnamurthy@vodafone.com]  the ticket OS-37304 was raised long time before OS-52308 but as long as OS-52308 is not closed we cannot check further on OS-37304

OS-37304 is different issue than OS-52308 but blocked by OS-52308

And we have explained the issue of OS-37304 several times since months, so issue here should be clear ;;;","25/Apr/24 3:22 PM;ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com;Further analysis blocked by [OAF-744] IMPR Omnius CHCK: As an Agent i wanted to update Payer Bank account validation in case of Cable order has giga products (e.g giga TV), so that giga tv orders will not stop in Omnius - Vodafone Global Jira;;;","29/Apr/24 12:59 PM;ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com;I am assigning it for now to me, as both Srujana and Harsha are not in anymore. Also I know how to retest it. 

Expecting delivery of OAF-744 to ACC1 on 15.5. - after that I will check if behavior here is still reproducible (pretty sure it is, as the use case is completely different one);;;","16/May/24 5:49 PM;ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com;Retest failed on ACC1 

For this specific scenario still the flow is blocked. its not fixed by CR780/OAF-744 which was deployed today to ACC1

Steps to reproduce

1) Start new order entry for new customer, enter any GERMAN adress
2) Select KUD product from list e.g. Giga TV home Net 
3) proceed to checkout, residence information is displayed (OK)

!image-2024-05-16-14-18-29-777.png|width=1039,height=674!
4) Fill Checkout sections until IBAN section

+*IMPORTANT TO FOLLOW NOW EXACT STEPS*+

5) Click on credit card SYMBOL and enter Sort Code from a German bank institute e.g. 70050000 and any bank account number 

!image-2024-05-16-14-16-28-620.png|width=766,height=490!

6) click on ""Ermitteln"" -> automatically the system creates a valid GERMAN IBAN {color:#de350b}*(IT IS NOT A FOREIGN IBAN)*{color}

!image-2024-05-16-14-17-37-757.png|width=912,height=701!

7) Select Invoice adress and try to proceed -> Error is shown that there is foreign IBAN (WRONG, its GERMAN IBAN) or different invoice adress (WRONG, its not different)

!image-2024-05-16-14-19-58-501.png|width=1008,height=758!

The IBAN is a correct GERMAN IBAN - its just not typed in into the IBAN field but created automatically by the system when entering bank account number and sort code !!

ali;;;","15/Dec/22 8:01 PM;heike.eisenlohr1@vodafone.com;I think this bug was created when we did not receive any status updates due to some misconfiguration in the weborder DB. We fixed that configuration issue on Nov 8 (WeborderDBRelease 2190.2022.11.00.03). 
Since then it should work, also for manually approved orders since the weborder ID should be sufficient to get an order status.
Does the error still occur? If yes, do you have example orders? ;;;","16/Dec/22 2:06 PM;ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com;as per latest Discussion with Daniel, the customer ID is relevant to get the status.

At the same time we received order status completed for all orders which got auto approved.

Created 2 orders that went into manual.
We got them approved, one as a new customer order, one as an existing customer order. (this doesn't change the status, it remains open)
We got them closed (this changes the status)
The status closed was picked up by the UOTracker and is also visible from OSF (This means that we didn't find a bug)

Our current best guess from looking at the screenshots is that: in that case the order was only approved and not closed and as such the order status didn't change, so there was nothing to show in OSF.;;;","11/May/23 4:47 PM;ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com;[~singireddy.reddy@vodafone.com]  can you please run one test case again on ACC1 with manual approval?

Please check as well if the customer id is transferred back to OSF

can you please check it with Cable?;;;","27/Oct/23 5:45 PM;ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com;I have the feeling we are running around in circles here.

Very long time ago I already mentioned that I assume we are not getting back the real customer ID and therefore we do not get the status completed

!image-2023-10-27-14-14-19-815.png!

 

1) in case the order is auto approved, we immediately get back the customer ID from unity backend, and it works fine

2) in case the order is manual approved after some time, somehow a second ""update"" is missing, which would return the customer ID 

But through all the discussions it was stated it should not be a problem in this area. I still feel that this gap is somewhere in this process.

Maybe we should have a call with all relevant parties -> OGW and VKD Gateway team ;;;","15/Nov/23 2:57 PM;devi.jampana@vodafone.com;Hi [~ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com] [~ran.farjun1@vodafone.com]

Yes for the Manual orders , success status is not reached in Telesales

Retail orders are working fine

As in defect steps it was mentioned retail, we tried placing orders with Retail

Changing the defect description to avoid further confusion

 

Regards

Srujana;;;","27/Nov/23 2:21 PM;ran.farjun1@vodafone.com;Hi,

so after the meeting today we agree that we need to check with Cable why OGW is not getting customer id in any of the set order status.
this is the reason why oneDMS call is failing.;;;","27/Nov/23 4:28 PM;ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com;The discussion in the beginning of this defect and my understanding all the time:

In case order is auto approved, customer ID is immediately given back to VKD Gateway
In Case order is NOT auto approved but later manually, there is no new call to get the customer ID -> thats why its not available

But in between it was mentioned that this is not the issue - as its working for retail, its strange that not working for Telesales.

Please note that OneDMS is handling Telesales Unity like VKD for Contract Summary Archiving. Not sure if relevant.

2. Nina Pickl, Vodafone will discuss with Ari regarding Temp Id.;;;","30/Nov/23 11:01 AM;devi.jampana@vodafone.com;Hi ,

Outcome of yesterday call:

After investigation with Nina and Rohan , 

We got the information that for Auto approval orders we can see the customer number and Unified Order ID ,so success status is reflecting in OSF

But for Manual approval orders, Customer id is not available in logs and also Unified Order ID is missing and Action is getting skipped

Because of this issue , OGW is not sending the success status

We have to check on this issue with Unity BackEnd Developer

Will keep the updates posted

Hi All,
Thank you all for joining the call!!
 
Please find the final Action points below from our call today:

Action Point:

	1. [~nina.pickl@vodafone.com] will check with [~ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com] and update the defect. If required then CR will be raised.


;;;","07/Dec/23 1:51 PM;nina.pickl@vodafone.com;Updates:

 

OGW needs the customer number in case Unity Manual Approval Orders in Telesales and Retails, which should be provided from VKD to OGW within the existing FulfillmentStarted Request.

 

The customer number is atm provided only for Auto Approval Orders, but missing for Manual Approval orders, therefore the document cannot be archived and the OGW processing remain in status pending (the VKD status is SUCCESS but the orders don't get Sucecss status in OSF Fronend):

An error was encountered while invoking ScanView-SaveDocument WS. Details [Error_Code: HTTPOutbound_0001, Error_Message: Received a fault from processing server for service '/ScanView-001/SaveDocument': An invalid number format or number value was encountered.

Note: Retail Manual Approval Orders don't have this issue because the call to oneDMS/Customernumber is not needed for the E2E flow. They get the Status Success.

 

As the customer number has not been sent for Manual Approval Order until now, a new PST change is required.

I will take the topic with me and check if we can request this change at the PST CAT train, Team Ash(Benjamin Sachse) or Nora.

 

The new requirement should contain following information:
 * no difference between retail and telesales from cable perspective
 * example set status messages received by OSF
 * fulfilment started from manual approval 
 * fulfilment started from automatic approval 


 * explanation on
 * what you clicked to create the manual approval order
 * how to approve the manual approval order

Will update here once it is clear how to process with the new change.;;;","18/Dec/23 3:04 PM;nina.pickl@vodafone.com;In Progress by PST Ash Team, corresponding Jira Ticket in PST Jira:

Hi [~nina.pickl@vodafone.com]  Could you confirm that whether the change was done in ACC1 as well?

test2b is planned to be updated with the Fix on 15th of January.

Previously when the order worked ,it was in TEST1B

After it was changed to TEST3B 

May be the changes were not there in TEST3B?(Just a doubt)

 

Regards

Srujana;;;","23/Jan/24 6:49 PM;simon.auch@vodafone.com;The test3b and test1b should both have sufficiently new versions deployed with the changes.

Some time ago you had a retest where a manual approval order was updated to status completed in OSF, could you also provide the logs for that order?

 ;;;","26/Jan/24 3:19 PM;ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com;I do not think that we can get these old logs anymore, not sure if we had restarts of servers in between.

Lets do one thing:

1) one retest on ACC1 test2b
2) one retest on ACC2 test3b

As far as I understood from Simon, solution should be present on both cable backends

[~simon.auch@vodafone.com] 

Elango performed the same flow on the both environments ACC1/test2b and ACC2/test3b- on ACC2/test3b worked fine, but not on ACC1/test2b.

Can you please check if the fix is available on test2b or what can be the reason otherwise?

 ;;;","01/Feb/24 4:26 PM;simon.auch@vodafone.com;So, the obvious difference between test3b (working) and test2b (not working) is that on test3b the status update is a `COMPLETED_SUCCESS` while on the test2b it is a `IN_PROGRESS_FULFILLMENT_STARTED`.

It can be seen that the unity order tracker on the test2b does not trigger any more updates for the order after the one with the status OPEN (for which we already have a customer ID as seen in the log).

I checked the test2b database contains the UME_ORDER_STATUS 'COMPLETED', which is correct, but apparently not written by the unity order tracker. Maybe there is a race condition between the unity order tracker and some other service that tries to write this field? This would also explain why it only happens sometimes.;;;","01/Feb/24 4:47 PM;nina.pickl@vodafone.com;[~elango.durairaj@vodafone.com]  Can you please check if the test2b order was successfully approved AND closed in Unity Backend?

Was it not agreed/ implemented, that the customer number should be transferred in fullfilment started status?

 * As expected we still see some updates that are created by an artifact that is not supposed to track unity orders:
{code:java}

Which in turn still results in some updates send to OSF that are missing the customer id:
{code:json}
posted orderStatus {
  ""unifiedOrderId"" : ""1780729"",
  ""webOrderId"" : 8057461,
  ""orderStatus"" : ""IN_PROGRESS_FULFILLMENT_STARTED"",

    {
      ""statusType"" : ""EVENT_DETAIL"",
      ""system"" : ""cable"",
      ""eventCode"" : ""OTHER"",
      ""eventPresentationText"" : ""OTHER"",
      ""eventValue"" : ""OTHER""
    }
  ]
}
{code}

 * The update by the unity order tracker however did work and was also successfully published to OSF:
{code:json}
posted orderStatus {
  ""unifiedOrderId"" : ""1780729"",
  ""webOrderId"" : 8057461,

      ""eventValue"" : ""543070901""
    }
  ]
}
{code}

My assumption right now is, that the ""lost"" updates before where due to the environment issues on VFW side and we actually only have the issue of updates that are send by another VKD system that are not supposed to be sent for VFW orders.;;;","27/Mar/24 4:08 PM;ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com;[~simon.auch@vodafone.com]  I am not really sure if I understand your comment correctly.

The ""lost"" updates most likely were due to the environment issues on VFW side, or at least we cannot reproduce them anymore since they have been fixed.
The problematic updates sent to OSF by other cable systems that are missing the customer ID, should not happen anymore.

I wrote a mail to the possibly relevant contact persons for unity, you, and Ariadne, which should explain the issue.

There is currently no way I can help with this issue on the test2b nor any way how I can tell you when it will be fixed as this is up to unity colleagues.;;;","10/Jun/24 12:41 PM;elango.durairaj@vodafone.com;[@Asmitha Gayam, Vodafone (External)|mailto:Asmitha.Gayam@Vodafone.com], Below mentioned order approved manually from my end and not auto approved,

if incase this order also not success then i will arrange a call to sort out this issue as priority, thanks in advance for all your cooperation's for this fix.;;;","27/Jun/24 4:02 PM;simon.auch@vodafone.com;The problem is still the same as before:
We do not get an updated order state from unity.
The pending order state we get from unity is still ""APPR"" and no order state can be retrieved from unity.
This can also be checked by trying it out in the swagger ui of minerva adapter: [https://z3-test1b-app-wss-orderaut-lb.kabeldeutschland.de/MinervaAdapterService/swagger-ui/index.html#/OrdersController/orderStatusByWeborderId]

Searching for the order status results in:

{
  ""httpCode"": 500,
  ""messageIdentifier"": ""GENERIC_ERROR"",
  ""message"": ""500 Server Error: \""{<EOL>  \""errors\"": [<EOL>    {<EOL>      \""code\"": \""QUERY_EXECUTION\"",<EOL>      \""message\"": \""[SQL0204] SPPORDERX in ANYPOINT type *FILE not found.\""<EOL>    }<EOL>  ]<EOL>}\"""",

  ""cancellationReason"": ""UNKNOWN""
}
{code}

Edit: 
I'm not sure this is currently exactly the same issue as before as also successful orders cannot be found by the endpoint. Independent of this, however it is still an issue that can only be solved by unity.
There is currently no way I can further help with this topic as the issue is (according to my analysis) on unity side and I do not have access to it. Also notice that I already shared all unity contacts I have, to further progress with this topic please arrange a meeting with them. Feel free to invite me to the meeting.
