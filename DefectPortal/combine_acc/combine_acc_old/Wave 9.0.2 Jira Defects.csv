we have discussed this defect together with Gaurab from Amdocs in one of the sessions, last week, in which we analysed E2E the expected behaviour and discussed some defects.

Also Waldemar and Michael Heller were involved.

 

1. What I miss in this error description is the EXACT activities, that the agent/tester has done.

my assumption is:  the agent has selected the unsharp sim swap (which is a possibility in Retail, that will disappear with the esim Push Epic, but is still available if the permission for insert sim_serial_number is set (I think)

so..  question:  did indeed the tester select the UNSHARP SIMSWAP?

 

Because:

IF Agent selects UNSHARP SIMSWAP, 

THEN SubmitOrder.SIMCARD = E (as it always was)

and... OGW is triggered to send the emails when SIMCARD =E

(so.. this is not correct)

 

AS AGREED WITH GAURAB :

Amdocs will change/improve the software:

OGW will not only check for SIMCARD = E,  but will also check whether the NEW_SIM_SERIAL_NUMBER is not populated.

only then the emails will be sent;;;","30/Dec/24 3:46 PM;ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com;[~akash.ubbu@vodafone.com]  [~ajay.bhavar@vodafone.com]  [~elena.fueger@vodafone.com]  can you comment on the question from Rob?

-> did indeed the tester select the UNSHARP SIMSWAP?

 

(set to ""in progress"" again - as per comment amdocs is working on a fix);;;","30/Dec/24 5:25 PM;ajay.yashwantbhavar@vodafone.com;-> did indeed the tester select the UNSHARP SIMSWAP?

Hello [~robert.goebbels@vodafone.com] In both cases, Email is getting triggered, As the parameter SIMSWAP reason is always handed over to OGW with the value VR (Unsharp) even if the agent has selected Sharp (VS) in front end.

Please find below screenshot from submit order request.

!image-2024-12-30-17-19-16-405.png|width=485,height=600!;;;","30/Dec/24 9:12 PM;ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com;[~robert.goebbels@vodafone.com]  please check the comment from Ajay and let us know if anything still unclear ;;;","08/Jan/25 12:04 PM;gaurav.lanjewar1@vodafone.com;Hi [~robert.goebbels@vodafone.com]  could you please check & share your observations.;;;","13/Jan/25 8:46 PM;robert.goebbels@vodafone.com;So final outcome  (my understanding)

Summary: 
 * works as (wrongly) designed
 * Amdocs will fix this without the need of a Change Request
 ** OGW will not only check:  is SIMTYPE E, in order to trigger the emails, BUT also check if the SIMNumber is empty

 

Details:

RETAIL channel; blocking permissions set:
 * agent must therefore insert SIM number (instead of SIMTYPE) AND
 * agent has possiblity to select Sharp vs unsharp simswap 

Omnius sends in submit Order
 * SIMYPE E, because agent has selected unsharp SIMSWAP (not clear to me, but it looks like Omnius also sends SIMTYPE E, if the agent selected sharp SIMSWAP, if I understand the comments right). 
 * SIMSERIAL number (because Agent has inserted a (physical) SIMnumber 

OGW triggers 5910 and/or 5930 email although the agent has inserted a (physical)  sim number

 

Solution: Even if Omnius sends SIMTYPE E,  OGW must also check, if a SIMNumber is provided  in submitOrder.  if the simnumber is empty, only then trigger the emails

can you please attached them here;;;","28/Sep/24 5:26 PM;gagan.patkar@vodafone.com;Hi [~ran.farjun1@vodafone.com] 
We are performing GUI testing for ACC3, so basically all retrieve customers are triggering OGW services in backend.
As we had agreed long ago, I had attached the respected test data (customer) and login Id (correlation id) along with the Kibana monitoring service logs for your reference.
I believe you can easily find the OGW services which are taking time once you with go through the logs attached. 
For you reference I have also sent you Catalina logs through H2H file transfer.;;;","30/Sep/24 1:02 PM;ran.farjun1@vodafone.com;In this defect , it's not specified from OGW POV where is the delay exactly .
e.g we have seen that correlation id being used for 3 OGW services
1) Legacysearch 
2) GetCustomerDetails
3) GetProductAvailability
To investigate anything further we will exact OGW service details which is causing delay.
Also we tried to analyse <CorrelationID>1clpme6urq144am5p9pl83q0ki</CorrelationID> where VFDEGetCustomerDetails  is getting called twice .

 

Please share valid data to investigate further with more detailed details of OGW service;;;","30/Sep/24 1:19 PM;gagan.patkar@vodafone.com;!screenshot-1.png|thumbnail!
I hope this info will be helpful for you.

Please find the attached image of a table that describing the Service calls for OSE, OIL and OGW,

Apart from this if the degradation is not from the OGW end or from Environment itself Please provide a statement that the degradation is not due to OGW so I can assign the ticket to TechM for further analysis.

the issue here is that we are not getting the order line in the set order status.

Discussions are still on going with BA;;;","23/Sep/24 2:45 PM;ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com;This is really urgent to find the root cause. still we are not sure whats the impact in production;;;","24/Sep/24 12:47 PM;ran.farjun1@vodafone.com;from our BA:

We have identified a new gap in ESIMPush epic, at least for me it looks like a solution gap.

Following are the scenarios :
 # ShiptoStore
 # Telesales/Retail
 # VORAS sending us status [VORAS_FINAL_SUCCESS_SHIP_TO_STORE_HANDOUT] in StOrderStatus (after H/W is handed out), with OmniusOrderID as OGWSubOrderId .

 

Expectation and issue:

 
 # OGW will identify the OGWOrderID using the OmniusOrderID and then subsequently the Subcriber Information to perform the ESIMPush procedure [ GeteSIMInfo + MaintainEID] .
 # Currently this is failing as in the request we don’t have OrderLineID , hence OGW doesn’t know which OrderLine to pick for subscriber information [it will be trickier if more than one OrerLineID associated with the order] to fetch the Subscriber Info to progress further.

 

Please note: VORAS doesn’t have OrderLineID in talesales scenario.

 

We need to discuss together to close the gap.

Hi Yogesh,

Connected over call along with +Anja Durben, Yogesh and Ashutosh+ and we found that somehow one specific role not assigned to the agent and due to that *Geschäftsfunktion ändern* not visible. Hence rejecting this defect as it is configuration issue.;;;","19/Sep/24 12:15 PM;yogesh.borade1@vodafone.com;In troubleshooting call we have made permission change as per confirmation with Anja in roles to view the secondary roles over the frontend portal,
 
Cops Agent - Added permission ALLOW_TELESALES
Support Super-Agent - Added permission ALLOW_TELESALES
OSF_PROJECT_ADMIN - Added permissions ALLOW_TELESALES & ALLOW_RETAIL
RETAIL_BO_SUPPORT_AGENT – Added permissions ALLOW_TELESALES & ALLOW_RETAIL
RETAIL_FI_AGENT – Added permission ALLOW_RETAIL.
RETAIL_PA_AGENT -– Added permission ALLOW_RETAIL
 
We have asked Anja to raised role addition request(RETAIL_FI_AGENT and RETAIL_PA_AGENT) via nGUM, now she is able to see the changes business function option along with her secondary roles as well hence issue is resolved.

In the shared MODE4 response, for the MSISDN(1727829737 ,1727829722)subscriber status is “A” which means these are active hence coming in the MTAN list

Kindly share the information by checking Tarif( *GM1XSPH05* and *GC22ULOS),* if these tariff option is the category 'MOBILE->MTAN_NOT_ELIGIBLE' or not?

The svas service crashed several times over the whole day.

First we thought, it was the patched version of svas regarding the thumb-nail issue, but at the end this was not the reason.

Even using the original version that is running on these systems over years, did not change the crash rate.

Since midnight today, there are no further crashes of the svas service to see on PR.

The only thing, I changed was to remove a registry setting according to a ACL memory leak in Windows, that I son longer to be used under 2019 and later.

But this change was done in the morning and had no effect on the crashes.

Hi, this is invalid defect
As this is stub issue due to missing data in OGW response of stub customer


Mobile :

!image-2024-09-06-12-24-49-551.png!!image-2024-09-06-12-25-05-971.png!

check OGW reponse of the stub 
there should be 2 new fields 


 
 {{<TargetSystem>Mobile</TargetSystem>}}
 
 {{<CustomerID>10014030</CustomerID>}}
 
!image-2024-09-06-12-25-52-454.png!
This field is mapped from OGW TO OIL in the defined path according to CR760 PART2

to verify mapping , check OSE response

!image-2024-09-06-12-26-25-224.png!

If OSE response for stub does not contain these two values 
TARGET SYSTEM & ACCOUNT CATEGORY FOR any stack in legacy search the stack indicator will not be seen 

CABLE

OGW response of cable customer 

!image-2024-09-06-12-27-18-475.png!

DSL 

OGW response for DSL stub

!image-2024-09-06-12-27-43-038.png!

!image-2024-09-06-12-28-17-497.png!

Note : as per the logs shared for customer stub from *ACC3 environemnt i notice this TargetSystem & AccountCategory tags are missing,* edit the stub to see the result for stack indicator

But Logic is changed as per CR-760 Part -2 Epic ? because when we compare it with ACC1 and ACC2 there is no change in OGW response its same as ACC1 and ACC2 and its working fine there,so it should work as per regresssion;;;","09/Sep/24 6:09 PM;gaurav.lanjewar1@vodafone.com;Hi [~vikash.saurav@vodafone.com]  need your input on Pallavi's comment.

Kindly check and update further ;;;","11/Sep/24 1:33 PM;atharva.paskanthi@vodafone.com;[~vikash.saurav@vodafone.com] could you please check and reply to Pallavi's comment;;;","11/Sep/24 5:22 PM;vikash.saurav@vodafone.com;Pragathi Prakash added a comment -
 
 
[~pallavi.kokate1@vodafone.com] 
Compare the OSE & OIL builds on ACC1 , ACC2 , ACC3. 

The OGW response is updated from CR760 Part2 OIL story. Ose code is functionating based on this OIL change.
Where ever CR760 part2 OIL & OSE functionality is deployed, ie if its on ACC3 , then the above sentence applies. 
If CR760 PART2 OIL & OSE functionality is not deployed ie, if its not on ACC1 & ACC2 then it will behave like previously. 
So check the build for OSE& OIL .;;;","11/Sep/24 5:36 PM;pallavi.kokate1@vodafone.com;[~vikash.saurav@vodafone.com] 

Yes on ACC1 and ACC2 its behaving correctly but As per CR760 Part-2 (ACC3) if Target system and Customer account and Parent account field is not visible for Prepaid customer then that is issue, It should be visible then because for other customer its visible ;;;","12/Sep/24 7:27 PM;vikash.saurav@vodafone.com;Pragathi Prakash added a comment -

ACC1 build - v9.20.0-BB27 2024-08-30 09:35 |09-11|21-46

ACC3 build - v9.19.8-BB7 2024-09-04 09:51 |09-12|03-58 - CR760 PART2 

As discussed
as per OIL story is about mapping OGW to OIL 
OGW - TargetSystem , CustomerID to OIL - AccountCategory,ParentAccountNumber/ID

https://jira.sp.vodafone.com/browse/OAF-785

Due to this issue, VKD system is adding FIRMA as a salutation for this request in backend but When customer is activated in backend and agent tries to perform in-life sales flow on same customer, Omnius asking to select value for salutation field.

As discussed - Omnius is having only Mr & Mrs values for Cable SOHO customer in checkout & VKD backend is having only FIRMA value for salutation in backend for Legal customer.

There was a discussion especially about ILS flows and the feedback from Business was:

At ILS there is no “nationality” field for DSL and cable orders, but there is for mobile. The mandatory field will then be empty in the future, meaning you will have to ask the customer again about his or her nationality.

 

Actually we also discussed if it should not be displayed for Mobile ILS, this was wrong from business perspective. But Thorsten Lehnert decided to not change anything, so Mobile is different than DSL/ Cable.

So from my point of view its not a defect as field is not expected for DSL and Cable ILS;;;",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Hi Natasa,

 

The repairDb cron job setup is not done on ACC3 and is also not working on ACC2. This was causing the issue.

Fixed: The TID team executed the repairDb.php script on ACC3, which resolved the PCAT issue. This script needs to be executed with every PCAT publish.;;;","05/Sep/24 5:41 PM;natasa.dimovic1@vodafone.com;Retest on ACC3:

 ;;;","14/Aug/24 1:47 PM;rohan.kumbhar@vodafone.com;As Discussed, post the OGW changes related to FastSearch flow-- we have the below current valid behavior:
Below Flow flow will be always triggered until OGW keeps receiving Intermediate status as ""Customer created"" from DSL backend
DSL--> OGW will call In progress (Customer created) status
OGW-->OneDMS Will call: In Progress Doc-Archiving(internally it will call FastSearch/Save Document
As per the BAU flow from DSL backend systems-- they will be sending the above intermediate status of customer created--multiple times to keep updating OGW about customer creation until they complete the order and send ORDER_COMPLETED status to OGW.
OGW will stop calling InProgress Doc Archiving status as soon as it receives the updated status as ""ORDER_COMPLETED""
Bottomline: Multiple In Progress Doc Archiving status call are expected from OGW -->OneDMS --as DSL backend will be sending this intermediate status to OGW until the Order is getting completed at backend.;;;",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Hi [~shubhangi.gholap@vodafone.com] 

Please check Right OSE BUILD, OIL BUILD , SPIN eligible customer stub for standalone cable, check BO permission SPIN_AUTHENTICATION is assigned to agent role, Check BO configurations in service setting for SPIN authentication. 

Check all the configurations, permissions, above mentioned checkpoints on ACC3 environment & then revert back

Hi [~pallavi.kokate1@vodafone.com] 
I`ve analyzed the logs you provided and also existence of similar issue in the past. There are several cases to discuss. As far as I can see, the OIL logs are successfull as well as OGW for SubmitOrder Request. May I ask you to provide exception.log from linux server and, if it is possible a part of trace.log for the period of time you encountered the issue.

Hi [~pallavi.kokate1@vodafone.com] v ,
thank you for the update.

According to the provided exception log, there are a lot of errors like
1. Exception: RetrieveCustomerInfo Service war nicht erfolgreich : An error was encountered while invoking KIAS GeteSIMInformation WS.Details [Error_Code: EAI002616 , Error_Message: ActivityTimedOutException , Error_Type: Infrastructure , Error_Severity: E , Error_Information: BWENGINE-100029:Activity timed out in /opt/SP/WEB_DATA/ACC3/omnius/osf-telesales-int-acc3/app/code/community/Omnius/Service/Model/Client.php:2

2. Exception: RetrieveCustomerInfo Service war nicht erfolgreich : A timeout has occurred calling a backend service (OGW). Please contact support if the error persists. in /opt/SP/WEB_DATA/ACC3/omnius/osf-telesales-int-acc3/app/code/community/Omnius/Service/Model/Client.php:2

May I ask you to check these errors with OGW Team? 
In case the error persists after fixing OGW, may I ask you to share a part of trace log from linux server (not the SubmitOrder log) and exception log?

Hi Taher,

added a comment -

Detailed RCA:

Earlier the reason for website_code getting deleted because somehow one script got executed where we haven't mentioned the website_code column. so we have added website_code column in that script also and written the seperate script for adding website_code if in case website_code not found in table.;;;","28/Aug/24 1:13 PM;shubhangi.gholap@vodafone.com;Again, we are facing same issue getting empty file so reopened the defect

Hi [~shubhangi.gholap@vodafone.com]  , connected call along with VF colleagues.

As per the findings post our last patch website-code columns goes missing issue got solved and job executing successfully.

So i can confirm that CR760 functionality working fine.

As part of analysis what we found is the database entry and job execution is in different time Zones. So as part of testing , we are executing job continuously so sometimes that file getting empty due to time Zone difference that last entry data going beyond last job executed time.

so using --debug param we can compare job last run and data in db table post that time.

 

Note:- that time Zone difference is need to be analyzed, either because of any configuration / settings / regression issue that happening;;;","02/Sep/24 4:43 PM;gaurav.lanjewar1@vodafone.com;Hi [~shubhangi.gholap@vodafone.com]  can you please check this and update here.;;;","02/Sep/24 5:28 PM;shubhangi.gholap@vodafone.com;Hi, 

We retested the issue 

As per above comment By Vikash there is difference database entry and job execution are in different time Zones, we have observed that data after last run is coming into the file

checked this issue and found that nothing related to code as its worked with same timezone on both db insertion and job execution in our ST environment. So its need to be checked from configuration / infra as its purely ACC3 environment timezone issues

This issue might be related to backdating in timezones as customer retrieval timezones are correct in all OIL and OSE  but for customer search there is discrepancy in timezone Response from OIL to OSE inserting in DB extract table its in GMT and 2 hours behind other response are in CET timezones.

After troubleshooting issue we found the XML2 support files were not install, now issue got resolved with the help of Linux team , and new import_full.sh file provided by tech m to support on the latest software version, we have run that for testing purpose and its ran successfully.;;;","16/Aug/24 11:56 AM;ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com;There are still some clarifications pending between TID team and TechM, therefore we keep the defect open until complete process is clear 
 * SIT testing status needs to be shared
 * plan how to execute and run pipeline to remove and setup new xmlstarlet software is missing
 * is it required for full flow setup to build the application again on sandbox server (i.e php,nginx,ose and solstice deployment again) 

At the moment we only have a workaround solution in place but no permanent solution yet

Waiting for feedback ;;;","28/Aug/24 4:13 PM;ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com;Feedback from Pritam



Reason for PCAT issue is: 
 # On RHEL 8 the xml2 entity is not compatible. (xml2 is the utility which helps to parse the XML file on unix/Linux system)
 # So, the compatible utility for RHEL 8 is XML STARLET
 # We have installed it on the server.
 # However, in the application where we use the pcat_import.sh script to import the PCAT, xml2 utility was used to parse the xml files which is compatible with RHEL8.
 # Now the issue is, on ACC3 SB we have RHEL 8 (we need XML STARLET here) and on rest of all environments including prod we have RHEL7 (we have xml2 working)
 # So, to use this XML STARLET only in ACC3 SB there must be change in code, but this will break the other running environment including PROD.
 # To avoid this, we have received an additional file/script from tech m, only for ACC3 SB,  to be copied after deployment so it will use the mistarget utility to parse the file (loca.xml,sandbox.xml etc.)

So, in conclusion we have received the solution but is not rolled out or included in the standard s/w delivery. In my view this will be added once we upgrade all our environments to RHEL8.

Additional info from Pramod: we need to replace the import_full.sh file after every full deployment which was provided by Deepika to which support xmlstarlet to import the pcat files and publish it in ACC3 env. This new import_full.sh are not included in their code due to platform difference between SIT , ACC and Prod;;;","28/Aug/24 4:14 PM;ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com;Some more sessions have been done with TechM and following error was reported from Sneha:

_AMQ9999E: Channel 'CCMAWSPR.GATMQMPR' to host '46.108.219.199' ended_

_abnormally._

 __ 

_EXPLANATION:_

_The channel program running under process ID 14221680 for channel_

_'CCMAWSPR.GATMQMPR' ended abnormally. The host name is '46.108.219.199'; in_

_some cases the host name cannot be determined and so is shown as '????'._

_ACTION:_

_Look at previous error messages for the channel program in the error logs to_

_determine the cause of the failure. Note that this message can be excluded_

_completely or suppressed by tuning the ""ExcludeMessage"" or ""SuppressMessage""_

_attributes under the ""QMErrorLog"" stanza in qm.ini. Further information can be_

_found in the System Administration Guide._

_----- amqrmrsa.c : 632 --------------------------------------------------------_

 

To resolve the issue, we have updated sequence number for Gateway MQ channels and restarted Gateway MQ.

 

Now all the channels are up and running fine and messages are getting processed successfully,

Hi, Ariadne,

{*}{color:#de350b}yes, I can confirm that in any case where we book KIP + TV (no matter if Broadvision or not, no matter which order we book it in), no technician section should be shown{color}{*}. 

The reason why this fails is as I tried to point out in my comment below. It really is pretty confusing, I apologize for that. I had a call with Natasa where I explained the problem, because it really is a bit hard to grasp.

So again in case of Broadvision what happens is:
 - [In the KIP package] KIP is booked, TV Connect is added because of Broadvision ---> OSF understands that no section for KIP should be shown because KIP + TV is booked and remembers that

 - [In the TV package] TV Digital is booked ---> OSF understands that no section for TV should be shown because KIP+TV is booked

==> no KIP or TV technician section is shown

In case of Not-Broadvision:
 - [In the KIP package] Only KIP is booked, but not TV yet ----> OSF supposes that a technician section should be shown for KIP (because only KIP is booked) and remembers that
 - [In the TV package] TV Digital + TV Connect is booked ----> OSF understands that no section for TV should be shown because KIP+TV is booked, but doesn't update the reasoning for KIP

==> technician section is shown for KIP, but not for TV;;;","10/Jul/24 8:34 PM;tobias.pohlmann@vodafone.com;Hi guys,

so, yesterday, we were asked by [~timo.russo@vodafone.com] to change the behaviour for KIP-only bookings, too; [[PSTBUG-2380] OSF_One Sehberetischaft option is available on NE3, NE4 VVO and MNV addresses in OSF while booking KIP only for new customers - DE Jira (vodafone.com).|https://de.jira.agile.vodafone.com/browse/PSTBUG-2380]

With this change (product setup version V2390_2024_07_00_086), this symptom here will not occur anymore, so I guess we could close this ticket. I apologize for the confusion.

But the underlying bug – OSF doesn't update the technician options it will display for KIP when it is currently in the TV package – still needs to be fixed as it is also the cause for https://jira.sp.vodafone.com/browse/OS-58440 .;;;","15/Jul/24 12:36 PM;ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com;[~tobias.pohlmann@vodafone.com]  so means we should keep ticket OS-58435 on hold until it got fixed by PSTBUG-2380 and assign it to you instead of TechM?;;;","15/Jul/24 1:25 PM;tobias.pohlmann@vodafone.com;Yes, we can do that.

This issue is fixed in product_setup V2390_2024_07_00_086 for *self-install* addresses. But not yet for *not-self-install* addresses. Since this is a bit more involved we will do this with a different requirement that  [~timo.russo@vodafone.com] is currently writing but which is not quite here yet. 
So, this might come in PI-31 (not the upcoming one, but the one after).

I'd suggest to keep this open and assigned to me for now.;;;","18/Jul/24 2:22 PM;ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com;Thanks Tobias, please inform us when we can retest for not-Self-Install adress;;;","08/Aug/24 12:52 PM;natasa.dimovic1@vodafone.com;Hi [~tobias.pohlmann@vodafone.com] any update?

this will be fixed within this upcoming requirement:
[[PORPDT-536] VKD Removal of Ready-to-Watch (Sehbereitschaft) Section - Part II (770375) - DE Jira (vodafone.com)|https://de.jira.agile.vodafone.com/browse/PORPDT-536]

It is a candidate for the upcoming PI 24-31, which will start in the second half of September. Until then, we will not tackle this.;;;","23/Sep/24 6:35 PM;ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com;[~tobias.pohlmann@vodafone.com]  any update if this is part of October release cable?;;;","07/Oct/24 5:42 PM;tobias.pohlmann@vodafone.com;[~ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com]  [~natasa.dimovic1@vodafone.com] 

 Ah yes, you are correct.
We didn't do anything yet, but since OSF in the mean time fixed this bug:
OS-58440 OSF | Wave 9.0 | CR716 Futurize | Regression | when booking 1st TV and then KIP (not Broadvision) the technician option for TV is displayed in the Access Details - Vodafone Global Jira

this here is also solved. 

So, we can close this now. Thanks for bringing my attention back to this.

Sorry, I am uncertain: may I just close this, or does anyone with more authority need to do that?

Because, I just re-checked that bug (OS-58440) which was re-tested and marked as solved according to the comments, but when testing it now on ACC1 I still have the old problem, too. So, if I first book TV and then KIP and then go to checkout, then the technician option for TV is displayed.

Not sure if it came back somehow (or I am just confused right now), but I think once OS-58440 is fixed, OS-58435 should be fixed as well. And for me it looks like, both bugs are still present on ACC1.;;;","19/Oct/24 1:30 PM;natasa.dimovic1@vodafone.com;[~tobias.pohlmann@vodafone.com] you were right.

We have created a new bug for the same issue: OS-63508 OSF | Wave 9.1 | Regression | when booking 1st TV and then KIP (not Broadvision) the technician option for TV is displayed in the Access Details - Vodafone Global Jira this bug was resolved and could be retested successfully.

I've retested this bug here (OS-58435) again:

We will remove this feature that is incorrectly calculated by OSF in the scope of [[PORPDT-536] VKD Removal of Ready-to-Watch (Sehbereitschaft) Section - Part II (770375) - DE Jira|https://de.jira.agile.vodafone.com/browse/PORPDT-536]  anyway, so maybe it is not worth it to push OSF to do it, even though it is clearly still faulty Omnius-behaviour.

We are now not displaying the technician section when booking KIP only or KIP+TV.

For this reason, the technician state cannot leak from KIP to TV anymore (or rather, it will leak over, but it doesn't matter anymore).

Could you please re-test and confirm?;;;","30/Jan/25 6:22 PM;tobias.pohlmann@vodafone.com;The root problem persists – the KIP technician state is not updated when changes in the TV package are made. However, the business case changed on cable side with PORPDT-536, so that now, both for KIP-only customer as well as TV+KIP customer we do not want to show any section.

As we mentioned, it seems that the issue is with the response structure after enabling the third switch, which is causing the 500 errors.

 ;;;","09/Jul/24 6:41 PM;vishal.raut@vodafone.com;Hi all,

FYI as discussed in call, 
All the required data (OIL Logs, OSE logs, Lumen logs) has been shared with Waseem for further investigation.

Waseem will check and Sandeep will update for further action that needs to be done. ;;;","10/Jul/24 5:09 PM;gauri.bhagat@vodafone.com;Below are some of the findings after the call with Waseem,

It has impact ONLY IF all three switches are Yes If anyone of them is No then there is no impact. We have checked in PROD all three switches are set to 'No' So ACC team cannot decide for PROD, decision has to take by Fusion C team if they want Switches Yes. ;;;","10/Jul/24 6:57 PM;sandeepkumar.pradhan@vodafone.com;Hi All,

{*}Why issue Occurred{*}: Since all the 3 field for CustomerDataHUB Solution1 Settings and CustomerDataHUB Settings  such as

CustomerDataHUB Solution1 Settings 
1)Central Search ES Interfaces Enabled

CustomerDataHUB Settings
1)Legacy search and MRT Enabled
2)Enable CDH Interface
are set to ""Yes"" which breaks the API flow in current OSE build  which is not the case in ACC1 or PROD
in both these environment at least one of the them or all are set as ""NO"" where both customer search and Installed base working fine (for PRODUCTION all filed set as NO)


{*}Action plan{*}: we need to work with Vodafone design team to understand on what criteria these all filed need to switch on (Set as yes) after that or parallelly we need look from OSE prospective how we can handle these API irrespective of setting (all 3 set to YES or all 3 set to NO(working condition) or partial set of YES and NO (working condition))
 

Also PROD and ACC2 are almost equal we should ensure that ACC2 setting always same that of PROD else conf change leads to issue like this , Do understand that tACC2 setting can be change too for testing but it has to be known to an extent;;;","11/Jul/24 12:02 PM;ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com;[~sandeepkumar.pradhan@vodafone.com]  the settings on ACC and in PROD will never be exactly same, as we are always testing future topics in ACC which might not be live yet.
However, for these Fusion C switches we had topics in scope for different releases, so the functionality itself is live since a long time but with a technical go live.

1)[OS-8975] SOL0 - Search & display customer with product(s) mastered in solstice - Vodafone Global Jira -> implemented with Wave 7.0, tested with Wave 7.1  

2) [OS-11283] SOL1SE32 - Extending the OSF Search for Solstice Customers - Vodafone Global Jira -> initially implemented with Wave 7.2, because of needed enhancement tested again with Wave 9.0 

We are not having any new functionality, the switches are there since years. 
To retest your TechM fix for OS-56961 of course all switches had to be YES and in release Wave 9.0 they have been on YES in general most of the time, as OS-11283 was part of Wave 9.0 and tested by Fusion C team.

As ACC1 was used for Wave 8.2 of course ACC1 was different, as there only OS-8975 was live already (therefore only one switch was enabled) 

And as its technically live, Fusion C team can decide at any time to switch it ON in production. Its like any other technical go live, where functionaly is enabled in ACC but not yet in production.;;;","12/Jul/24 2:24 PM;ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com;Workaround: We have switched OFF SOL1 search for now, Fusion C team was informed about the situation and asked for solution / change

This can be either fixed by disabling the CDH sol1 search (elastic search) or increasing the threshold of displayed customers in the admin setting UI. fyi [~peter.nestvogel@vodafone.com];;;","22/Jul/24 4:56 PM;ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com;Internal TechM call with C1/Fusion is planned to discuss on further handling of this defect ;;;","12/Aug/24 8:31 PM;ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com;[~vikash.saurav@vodafone.com]  we need an update on this ticket to know how to handle the fusion C switch for extended search ;;;","22/Aug/24 4:03 PM;ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com;Talked to Vikas today, team wants to reproduce the issue on ACC2. Therefore we would need to activate the Fusion C search for some time, this needs to be aligned with [~gauri.bhagat@vodafone.com]  / [~ajay.bhavar@vodafone.com] ;;;","27/Aug/24 7:14 PM;akhilesh.sawarkar@vodafone.com;We attempted to replicate this in the ACC2 environment with Shweta and Sneha, and it appears that the CS API is functioning properly for both Fixed and Cable with all CDH interfaces enabled (which means all three switches are set to 'Yes'). We are able to search for customers using the GUI as well as the CS API.

Please see the attached evidence[^Defect_OS-58345_evidence.docx]

Hi All.

We delivered a debug patch for this issue to ACC1 on 17/12 under the reference CN#KIAS2000_CN_18936 however that debug patch didn’t help much to fix the issue and also didn’t indicate reason for failed again so we are validating further more on it, Soon we will update the action plan and that action plan include is to validate with API expert to Fastrack this issue resolution.,;;;","20/Dec/24 2:12 PM;daniel.loos@vodafone.com;regarding this specific error message, please be aware that enabling the extended search will also enable this unrelated setting in the default configuration:

Also, for the cable customers, the response structure is also incorrect.

 ;;;","14/Nov/24 9:53 AM;nina.pickl@vodafone.com;The new PCAT change with the new logic for ILS flows has been delivered to ACC1(Prodnear Env) and tested successfully by Franz and Simon with 4 different scenarios (see description below)

 

[~gokul.vade@vodafone.com]  [~ajay.bhavar@vodafone.com]

this ACC tracking Bug can now be retestet on ACC1 with the *+2nd scenario+* ->{+}{+}no Insurance option should be visible(see description below)

Existing customers on ACC1 they can be used for the retest:
|Customer ID|Subscriber Number|Tariff Option|SOC|
|104724208|GSM1738852612|GM1LH30 |24HATAV17|

|104058520|GSM1727077848|SMART3XXL|24HATAV17|

 

*(*)New Change(*)*

*+1st scenario:+*

SOC “sales expired” -> user with existing Legacy/Cover/Cover Plus insurance, which is no longer offered + Vodafone device, which was purchased no longer than 120 days ago

Expected result: Customer can book VC and VCP (with SOC “sales expired” = true)

*+2nd scenario:+*

SOC “sales expired”, but device too old -> user with existing Legacy/Cover/Cover Plus insurance, which is no longer offered, + Vodafone device, which was purchased more than 120 days ago

Expected result: User cannot book VC and VCP (with SOC “sales expired” = true)

Required existing customer: Contract with HW (purchase >120 days) & tariff + Legacy/Cover/CoverPlus SOC “sales expired” = true

 

*+3rd scenario:+*

SOC NOT sales expired -> user with existing Legacy/Cover/Cover Plus insurance, which is still offered + Vodafone device, which was purchased no longer than 120 days ago

Expected result: User cannot book VC and VCP (with SOC “sales expired” = false)

Required existing customer: Contract with HW (purchase <120 days) & tariff + legacy/Cover/CoverPlus SOC “sales expired” = false

 

*+4th scenario:+*

SOC NOT sales expired, but device too old -> user with existing Legacy/Cover/Cover Plus insurance, which is still offered + Vodafone device, which was purchased more than 120 days ago.

Without a fix the feature can not be deployed into production.{color}

 

Test data:

Browser: Chrome
Environment: ACC1 
Channel: Telesales + Retail

Steps to reproduce the issue:
 - Enter address: Goethestr. 27 26409 Wittmund Wittmund
 - Select package: ""Kabel Internet & Phone""
 - Select tariff: ""[3BV:B09] GigaZuhause 250 Kabel, 1.-9. Monat 19,99 €""
 - Select goody on ""Gutschriften und Aktionen"" section: ""[JL5] Gutschrift GigaZuhause Young: 1.-9. Monat: 0 €, 10.-24. Monat: -5 €, danach 0 €""
 - open basket

The prices are not calculated as expected.
As a consequence of the wrong basket also the contract summary is incorrect.

!image-2024-04-10-18-00-56-136.png|width=856,height=463!  

+Pre-Analyses of product configuration team:+
OSF uses the 'Price sliding' field from the Product Catalog to configure the way the price periods are shown in the frontend:

!screenshot-1.png|width=338,height=226!

The numbers in this field are however interpreted as absolute points in time. They should however be interpreted as relative time intervals.

+Concretely this means:+

Price sliding '9:6:' should be interpreted as 0.-9. month, 10.-15. month, 16. month onward.
Currently it is interpreted as 0.-9. month, 0.-6. month, whatever comes afterward.
This obviously does not make any sense, since the second period ends before the first one, so the consequence in the frontend is, that the second period is ignored.

+The obvious fix therefore is:+
The numbers in the ""Price sliding"" field should always be interpreted as *relative time* intervalls.

 

+Additional proof:+
When checking in the OSF Backoffice for the product properties, the price_sliding of JL5 looks like this:

!image-2024-04-09-15-34-39-869.png!

Looking at this in overview in the frontend, the second time intervall seems to be ignored:

!image-2024-04-10-18-00-56-136.png|width=423,height=229!

Manually changing it to 15 then leads to the following view in OSF:

!image-2024-04-09-15-42-29-039.png|width=737,height=206!

This is, however, still wrong. OSF seems to tread the numbers in the PCAT import as absolute times instead of relative intervals

=> Three sliding prices are in principle possible to show, but the configuration in the product setup is imported and interpreted wrongly",,alka.kshirsagar2@vodafone.com,ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com,atharva.paskanthi@vodafone.com,gaurav.lanjewar1@vodafone.com,gokul.vade@vodafone.com,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,OAF-762,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"02/May/24 12:50 PM;stephanie.krammer@vodafone.com;OSF Incident Ticket - CRImprovement notwendig - OS-54646 OSF  ACC1  Wave 8.2  sliding prices are not interpreted as expected - Vodafone Global Jira.msg;https://jira.sp.vodafone.com/secure/attachment/1281954/OSF+Incident+Ticket+-+CRImprovement+notwendig+-+OS-54646+OSF++ACC1++Wave+8.2++sliding+prices+are+not+interpreted+as+expected+-+Vodafone+Global+Jira.msg","10/Apr/24 9:33 PM;stephanie.krammer@vodafone.com;image-2024-04-09-15-34-39-869.png;https://jira.sp.vodafone.com/secure/attachment/1267853/image-2024-04-09-15-34-39-869.png","10/Apr/24 9:34 PM;stephanie.krammer@vodafone.com;image-2024-04-09-15-42-29-039.png;https://jira.sp.vodafone.com/secure/attachment/1267854/image-2024-04-09-15-42-29-039.png","10/Apr/24 9:30 PM;stephanie.krammer@vodafone.com;image-2024-04-10-18-00-56-136.png;https://jira.sp.vodafone.com/secure/attachment/1267849/image-2024-04-10-18-00-56-136.png","11/Apr/24 12:55 PM;stephanie.krammer@vodafone.com;pcat-without-fix.tar.xz;https://jira.sp.vodafone.com/secure/attachment/1268028/pcat-without-fix.tar.xz","10/Apr/24 9:32 PM;stephanie.krammer@vodafone.com;screenshot-1.png;https://jira.sp.vodafone.com/secure/attachment/1267851/screenshot-1.png",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,The issue is a show stopper for the Go Live of Young Promotion feature which is planned for April Main Release 29.04,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,OS-49399,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"v9.18.5-BB1 2024-04-02 06:59 |04-09|21-54",Fixed with CR826 in Wave 9.2 release ,,Cable,Omnius,ACC,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Green,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"0|i9j9qv:",9223372036854775807,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Backlog - UNCOVERED,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Code,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,TechM -> PCAT,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"11/Apr/24 11:55 AM;ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com;[~vikash.saurav@vodafone.com]  [~bharath.krishnamurthy@vodafone.com]  please check this on priority, if you need a call to discuss the details we can organize it but we need to be fast.

[~devi.jampana@vodafone.com] did you check the ticket Z_INC02716593A? This is not a cable bug, is there any new insights why the assignment to TechM was incorrect and this ticket was assigned to me again? ;;;","27/Dec/23 1:40 PM;devi.jampana@vodafone.com;HI [~simon.auch@vodafone.com]

We are not able to access TTWOS or at least only very limited people who are not available right now. Can you give us details about Z_INC02716593A? 

So is there also ticket raised towards TechM for this issue, even when opening the TV package in configurator first? 
If not, is this issue on TechM side as per your analysis and not related to cable rules setup?

[~ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com] I think the behaviour by OSF that the error message is shown in case a inconsistent technician selection is made by the agent can be assumed to be correct. I at least would not know what the expected outcome of such a selection would be.

The following part from your comment could be the solution to this:
{panel}
*BUT this is not expected as per Ticket from PROD:*

This means the option for TV is not visible anymore, if I got it right. Therefore there can also not be any mismatch between TV and KIP installation options.

Your assumption regarding the TV section then not being visible is correct.

From our tests I would also assume that the TV section shouldn't be visible in this case [Quelle von vkdTechnicianOptions.feature - productSetup - webgit (kabeldeutschland.de)|https://webgit.kabeldeutschland.de/projects/FE/repos/productsetup/browse/4DevelopmentOnly/tests/unified/features/availability/vkdTechnicianOptions.feature#239-259]:

As per the production ticket, it was mentioned that after selecting the TV product in checkout section and move forward

then the TV Access details should not be visible

The error message “Service PIN ist bei diesem Kunden nicht vorhanden” is displayed when Omnius gets the GET Call response from DXL with error code 404.

The behavior of the UI as defined in US OS-28489 is “The agent to be redirected to 3/4 authentication method window with a yellow banner message”

Hi [~natasa.dimovic1@vodafone.com] 

,As we verify the getcustomersearchresposne of both index search and legacy search we see,

Index search,,We receive 2 customer results one with cable and one with mobile, Hence you don’t see the SPIN message

as it is applicable for cable only

!image-2024-02-09-12-06-25-114.png!

Now when you did legacy search, the response had only cable and there was no mobile customer returned

hence it is cable only ,SPIN is applicable here and we show the message.

Hi Natasa,

When we search a cable customer ,the getCustomerResponse has below result which is indicating that it's linked customer but has only cable details from OGW, You see *NO* other stack data, Hence OSF considers this as a cable customer and sends a get request for indices to DXL (as service PIN is applicable)

but we get no indices from DXL ,so we have to fallback to standard authentication with an error message.

Hi Natasa,
 
 
 Cable customer details are what we are getting the single result from the response for GetCustomerInfo (even for linked customers the Authentication method will work for each of the stack that are associated.

it is required that there should be no differnce between the searches (Legacy and Index)!

in this case spin will not be applicable for index but for legacy as we receive only cable ,ose considers it as cable customer.

maybe we need to set up a call again.

this is what i can see from the requests:
1. in index search we are searching with link id, so OGW return mobile and cable customer.

2. in legacy search we are searching only the cable customer so we are returning only cable customer data.

is something else is expected?

 Not a valid defect toward Omnius.

CR716 ILS is not in scope. suggest to invistegate with VF Cable team for cable rulez plugin.
Note : *Technician needed* OR *SelfInstallation* dropdown options visiblity and respective product in SC logic is exisitng and controlled via cable rulez plugin.

In CR716
(ABK = Yes or No) and *YES* has only scope if there is *Technician needed* dropdown option possible then make this option preset in readonly AND also not add chargeable product in SC.

other than, everything is existing behaviour.;;;","22/Sep/23 7:13 PM;nina.pickl@vodafone.com;[~devi.jampana@vodafone.com]

Srujana;;;","20/Sep/23 4:07 PM;simon.auch@vodafone.com;This can be changed on cable side, but I am relatively sure that this was never implemented for Unity.

Without CR-716 the agent could select both ""Anschluss ist bereits sehbereit"" or ""Anschluss ist nicht sehbereit"" but only ""Anschluss ist bereits sehbereit"" would actually do anything (selecting a marker product).

With CR-716 only the option with a valid product selection is left, but functionally everything behaves just like before.
The agent basically just had the illusion of a choice before.

If this behaviour should be changed I think it needs to be clarified if there are other cases for unity in which (at a self install address) the option ""Anschluss ist nicht sehbereit"" should be selectable. The other ES* products come to mind for example.;;;","22/Sep/23 4:50 PM;nina.pickl@vodafone.com;In clarification:

*Open questions from my perspective:*
 * which products exactly control the display of the tv access details in OSF?

 ** Is this controlled by special tags on products or categories, or are the products hardcoded in OSF?
Maybe [~vikash.saurav@vodafone.com] can answer this question?
 * If the display of the checkout part is only controlled by TECYESTV and TECNOTV, this will not work (and from cable side never should have) for Unity, since these two products are not aligned and should never be available for Unity.
Which TV technician option should be bookable in Unity TV scenarios? As far as I am aware there is no TV technician product that is available in the Unity footprint.

 ** we have a list of ~80 test cases. Some of these are apparently not correct.

If we are following the below steps in ACC2 then we are able to see the Access details even now:

Steps:

1)select TV Product and KIP section 

2)select the TV Product

3)Donot select any product in KIP

4)Move forward it will throw an error that we have to select the KIP Product in check out section

5)Go back and select the KIP Product now

6)Move forward and fill customer details

7)Then we are able to see the access details for TV

Note:we tried this steps 3 to 4 times and we are able to see the access details once

[~devi.jampana@vodafone.com] for now I would ignore the case you had and focus on the scenario described in the ticket: a TV order without KIP.
I think my initial question is still unanswered:
When does OSF show the access details section for TV in a unity scenario?

If the answer to this question is ""when at least one product in the technician_needed_no or technician_needed_yes category is visible according to the cable product logic"" then the next question we need answered is why was the section shown in previous versions?

[~nina.pickl@vodafone.com] could you figure out a version where this worked last time?;;;","28/Sep/23 8:18 PM;simon.auch@vodafone.com;According to an answer from Vikash in another ticket [OS-42115] OSF | ACC2 | Wave 8.1 | CR716 Futurize regression defect | when booking KIP and TV the access details for TV are not displayed - Vodafone Global Jira
""It is hard to give an exact timing for this feature since it seems to have been implemented a long time ago. I recommend contact with Vodafone BA for more information.
Unity Media works exactly the same as normal Kable TV and KIP products to display the access details section."".
To me this is a direct conflict to the information that this ever worked in the (recent) past.
Without a specific version in which it worked before I have the feeling this discussing is not leading anywhere.

 ;;;","17/Oct/23 3:05 PM;simon.auch@vodafone.com;Hi Devi,

I have no clue what OSF is doing here, but definitely not how it should behave to the best of my knowledge.
I could reproduce the issue and make the following two screenshots:
!image-2023-10-17-11-31-41-319.png!
!image-2023-10-17-11-32-04-497.png!

Which shows that OSF thinks that 1V1/VP0/TECYESTV/TECNOTV should be selected. That is not correct since the last execution of the cable product logic up to that point in the checkout process returns none of these 4 products as visible.
For completeness I attached the log of the session up to the dropdown in the checkout: [^cable_rules_artifact_OS42066.log]

Please find out when the access details are shown in the checkout. All information until now seems to conflict with the unity case. Maybe there is a special handling for unity addresses hardcoded in OSF?;;;","19/Oct/23 11:57 AM;ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com;Hi [~simon.auch@vodafone.com]  

regarding ""All information until now seems to conflict with the unity case"" -> for CR716 we have raised also defects for VKD and not only for Unity, so something is in general wrong in this access details section.

As the latest observation happened after having new broadvision product catalogue in place, should we raise a defect against CR756? Or against Product catalogue?
I do not want to mix this defect here with behavior shown for broadvision products, otherwise will be even more confusing;;;","19/Oct/23 1:20 PM;simon.auch@vodafone.com;Hi Ariadne,
maybe it was not clear what I meant with ""All information until now seems to conflict with the unity case"":
 * We have multiple answers (in this ticket and in other tickets) saying that TECNOTV and TECYESTV control the display of the section (and did so in the past)

 * 
 ** this can't be the case for unity as those are not aligned products
 * In other answers it was mentioned that it is controlled not by TECNOTV and TECYESTV but by categories containing TECNOTV, TECYESTV, 1V1, VP0
 ** sound better, but also all of these products are not aligned and should never have been orderable for unity

In the newly encountered behaviour by Devi (https://jira.sp.vodafone.com/browse/OS-42066?focusedId=2974883&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels:comment-tabpanel#comment-2974883) suddenly the access details are shown. Even though TECNOTV , TECYESTV, VP0, and 1V1 are not bookable according to cable product logic?

Someone has to look into the OSE source code and check _systematically_ when this section is shown. I expect there to be _something_ hardcoded for VFW, but I cannot check that myself.

Without an explanation from OSE side when this section is shown I don't know how else to help with this defect. If it is supposed to be based on the orderability of specific categories {_}then the new behaviour is a OSE contradicts it because no product from that category is orderable in the scenario clicked by me{_}. So for starters this could be analysed and maybe we get some insight which logic we are missing from OSE.  

I would not open another defect for this observation.;;;","23/Oct/23 5:21 PM;ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com;we have agreed that general analysis of CR716 defects regarding installation logic is required. Andreas Baldermann will take a look at the defects, and then we probably need to come together with TechM and PST team.

Did you check ENV Adress with Selfinstall or without?;;;","12/Feb/25 10:29 AM;elango.durairaj@vodafone.com;[~ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com] we have checked TV Product in ENV address with Selfinstall ;;;","12/Feb/25 3:50 PM;ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com;[~elango.durairaj@vodafone.com]  I checked with Timo Russo

Self install adress ENV (without ABK Flag) -> No section visible in case of TV and/or KIP

technician adress ENV -> Section visible for TV

can you check that again based on this information ?;;;","12/Feb/25 6:19 PM;elango.durairaj@vodafone.com;[~ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com]  below is the observations 

*Selfinstall yes and without ABK Flag :*

for TV --Access details are not available

for KIP --Access details are available

*Technician Required and Without ABK Flag:*

for TV-- Access details are not available

for KIP---Access details are available

[^Access Details TV.docx];;;","12/Feb/25 8:26 PM;ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com;Hi [~elango.durairaj@vodafone.com]  this behavior is partially not correct

*Selfinstall yes and without ABK Flag :*

for TV --Access details are not available -> OK, so if this defect was about this behavior for selfinstall Adress we have to close it

for KIP --Access details are available -> not OK, details should not be available -> new defect

*Technician Required and Without ABK Flag:*

for TV-- Access details are not available > not OK, if this defect was about this behavior for non-selfinstall adress data we have to reopen it OR we have to open a new defect if this one was for selfinstall adress

for KIP---Access details are available -> not OK, details should not be available -> new defect

So for KIP you can open new defect as in any case it should not be available 
For TV you have to check what this defect was about originally, either reopen or close and open new one for non-selfinstall-adress;;;","14/Feb/25 3:13 PM;devi.jampana@vodafone.com;we are testing all usecases and again and will raise defects if there is any discrepency
