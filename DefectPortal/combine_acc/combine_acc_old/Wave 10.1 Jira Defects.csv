|Protocol|Tuxedo|
|Operation|eaiGtMarket|
|Service|CSM145|

the reply is not correct in almost all topics as highlighted in already attached email in yellow the bpName is sent  <bas:bpName>CustomerAccount002:SearchCustomerBANSubscriber as seen in Tibco logs. BKS would be something for FixedNet but this is Mobile for Kias so 2. Is wrong and bpName has to be corrected for SoapAction used.

 

Concerning 1. OGW1758878870199 Tibco does not care how OSF is generating their bpId but the 2 separate invocations of the service first for MMC then for MMO each have to have a unique bpId, that is a operational requirement as shared to all developing parties using Tibco EAI/ESB. If the timestamp only has definition of seconds then this is not sufficient to being unique, but this has to be ensure by each client. OGW has to correct this !

 

If OSF/OGW is using boId same as bpId then they did not understand the purpose of those 2 parameters and have to read the specifications.

 

Finally doing same request for both marketCodes MMC and MMO does not make sense, any customer can only belong to one market. This violates the principal of avoiding unnecessary load on backends Tibco EAI and Kias. If OGW does not know the market of customer/BAN according to spec the parameter can be sent as empty and Tibco will check by eaiGtMarket first.

I had a call with VF design team, and their expectation is to have these below possible values in ADT system.

somehow it was missed in our Technical US for #2 and #4,
 # NO_LEGITIMATION,

 # SOFT_AUTHENTICATION,

 # MTAN, 

 # SERVICE_PIN,

 # ALTERNATIVE

 # CUSTOMER_PASSWORD

VF consider this as valid defect. 
means, (SPIN_MOB_AUTHENTICATION and SPIN_CAB_AUTHENTICATION and future SPIN_DSL_AUTHENTICATION) considers as SERVICE_PIN

Hi Natasa,
 
This is expected behaviour of SPIN_CAB → when there is technical skip as per CR760 PART 5 
The error message shown is for the technical skip occured for the cable account when SPIN authentication was not possible for cab account. 
Hence same is applicable in this usecase for CR920


Explanation : 
1. As on CR760 Part5 ,if SPINCAB has technical skip , there will be red banner with the respective message over 2OFX window- (Radio button view) . ( as we have default auth as 2ofx with 2 radio button) 
2. As on CR909 the next default authentication if SPIN_CAB fails ( due to technical skip) is 3X4 ( as we introduced separate authentication & authentication windows for 2OFX & 3X4 in CR909) 
For a linked account ( MOB +CAB ) 
3. Hence for Mob account → SPIN_MOB is eligible for auth & has technical skip - next eligible auth is SPINCAB is offered: Working fine as per description 
and Cab account→ SPINCAB s eligible for auth & has technical skip - next eligible auth for cab account 3X4 is offered : working fine as per description , as well as we see SPINCAB was not possible with red banner message :- Working as expected from combined outcomes of CR760 PART 5 ( ref 1. ) , CR909 (ref 2.)
Hence we see red banner reason for why spin_cab authentication was not possible & next auth 3X4 is offered to continue. 
Evidence of valid output in production code 

We also request vfde_dxl_spin_mobile_service- & vfde_dxl_spin_service logs in order to verify the exact response obtained for each account.;;;","06/Oct/25 2:44 PM;nina.pickl@vodafone.com;After clarification with Thorsten and Heike,
""Service PIN authentication not possible"" is a correct message. 
Only the text ""technical error"" will be confusing for the agents, but no Go Live blocker.
We can close this Bug, an enchancement story will be placed.;;;","06/Oct/25 3:02 PM;ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com;if the change will be done based on this defect, we can set the defect on hold, until enhancement is in place. and decrease to prio 3;;;",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I've checked and can see SetOrder status is missing in TEM Portal for Mobile Prepaid but present in OGW DB.

[~rohan.kumbhar@vodafone.com] Could you please check, Here are the details for the prepaid order:

- Omnius ID: 1252005

- OGW ID: 3084686

Additionally, I checked the Mobile Postpaid orders and found that the SetOrder status is also missing there.
[~affan.baragazi@vodafone.com] Could you please look into the following details:

ACC2 Order details:

- Omnius ID: 1249407

- OGW ID: 3080330

 ;;;","03/Oct/25 1:22 PM;ajay.yashwantbhavar@vodafone.com;As discussed with [~affan.baragazi@vodafone.com], When OGW receives RECIEVE_ARVATO_FILENAME, there is no call to setOrderStatus. They are updating the CDM with ""OnHold-PendingHWFulfillment"" and calling pushOrderStatus without setOrderStatus.
We checked OS-3964 and OS-14388, Found the same behavior, No call to setOrderStatus.
Therefore, we are closing this ticket with WAD.

It is difficult to fix it because it occurs only in GIT.  In all other environments (3.TEST, PNA, PROD) the import of the September products was successfully.

I suspect therefore that the error is caused by a data problem in GIT and that it is not a software problem.

While performing legacySearch, OGW prepares the header params as follows:
1. bpId --> 'OGW' + currentTimeStamp

2. bpName --> 'OGW_BKSService:SearchCustomerBANSubscriber'

3. boId --> same as bpId

It then prepares the searchCustomerBanRequest and calls the service first with MarketCode as ""MMC"" followed by another call updating the marketCode to ""MMO"".
This implementation has been in place for quite some time. Please let me know if any further discussion is needed. Thanks;;;","03/Oct/25 12:40 PM;sneha.wayal1@vodafone.com;Hi Affan,

Can you please go through latest email from Andreas.

[^AW OSF OGW use of SearchCustBANSub001-SearchCustomerBANSubscriber (II).msg]

Hi Sneha,

 

the reply is not correct in almost all topics as highlighted in already attached email in yellow the bpName is sent  <bas:bpName>CustomerAccount002:SearchCustomerBANSubscriber as seen in Tibco logs. BKS would be something for FixedNet but this is Mobile for Kias so 2. Is wrong and bpName has to be corrected for SoapAction used.

 

Concerning 1. OGW1758878870199 Tibco does not care how OSF is generating their bpId but the 2 separate invocations of the service first for MMC then for MMO each have to have a unique bpId, that is a operational requirement as shared to all developing parties using Tibco EAI/ESB. If the timestamp only has definition of seconds then this is not sufficient to being unique, but this has to be ensure by each client. OGW has to correct this !

 

If OSF/OGW is using boId same as bpId then they did not understand the purpose of those 2 parameters and have to read the specifications.

 

Finally doing same request for both marketCodes MMC and MMO does not make sense, any customer can only belong to one market. This violates the principal of avoiding unnecessary load on backends Tibco EAI and Kias. If OGW does not know the market of customer/BAN according to spec the parameter can be sent as empty and Tibco will check by eaiGtMarket first.
|Backend Interface|KIAS|If marketCode field is empty in request, then the following Service will be invoked|
|Protocol|Tuxedo|
|Operation|eaiGtMarket|
|Service|CSM145|
|CSM service to SearchCustomerBANSubscriber|
|Protocol|Tuxedo|
|Operation|eaiSrchCstBan|
|Service|CSM144|

So this should be changed as well.

 

Pls add this full mail to ticket.

Kind regards, Andreas;;;","03/Oct/25 2:32 PM;affan.baragazi@vodafone.com;Hi [~sneha.wayal1@vodafone.com] ,
Yes, OGW is sending the bpName as 'CustomerAccount002:SearchCustomerBANSubscriber'. I'll check internally to understand the original requirement and investigate why this issue has suddenly surfaced.;;;","07/Oct/25 4:37 PM;ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com;[~affan.baragazi@vodafone.com]  do you have an update here?;;;","08/Oct/25 1:28 PM;affan.baragazi@vodafone.com;Hi,

[https://confluence.sp.vodafone.com/spaces/OF/pages/179825162/OGW+Service+2+LegacySearch]

According to the current design, OGW initiates two separate calls to EAI first for MMC, followed by MMO. The remaining parameters have been consistently functioning this way for quite some time. To discuss further and conclude, can you please arrange a call with the Design teams from Vodafone and Amdocs([~snehal.bankey@vodafone.com] ). Thanks

- The above 3 points were discussed with Andreas Knocke , Ketaki and Snehal
- As discussed nothing was changed and this is the behavior in Production env as well
- [~sneha.wayal1@vodafone.com] will update the ticket title and description and reduce priority to P3
- As Ketaki mentioned first 2 points will be fixed by this ticket in the upcoming deliveries.
- For the 3rd point we need to raise a separate P3 ticket as it is a Design Gap and need to be fixed via Change request;;;",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

hi [~devi.jampana@vodafone.com]  [~ajay.yashwantbhavar@vodafone.com] 

The ticket description total mislead to the actual problem statement.

even though we find the comment from OGW and expectation to send usecaseindicatioin value MOVECABCAB instead of MOVCABCAB is incorrect
based on refer demand OSIP-1242 is for OGW system change and not for TechM/Omnius sol.

 

And regards to CR266 it was developed based on demand OSPI-111 where this change was never requested.

Conclusion : This look to me, this is a demand issue related to Amdocs for this usecaseindicatioin value. could be typo. ref to incident https://jira.sp.vodafone.com/browse/OS-41212

!image-2025-10-07-10-45-18-357.png!

CR909 behavior is correct its for both channels.

If I looked the usecase in description
Agent login in *retail* channel and 2OFX and 3X4 authentication permission given.
and load Customer, that is *private* and having *mobile* account . 



expectation- system doesn’t offer anything neither 2OFX or 3X4
as per CR909 2OFX not possible to offer 
as well CR706 P3 3X4 is not offer in retails for mobile customer.
due to both restriction, UI s/f doesn’t offer any authentication.

[~anuradha.chougule@vodafone.com]  As it is prefilled based on the DOB in kunden data section,it is not stored as a checkout parameter under legitimation section, hence when you reload the saved cart we might not get this DOB in legitimation section populated .

for save cart we need to have this functionality implemented to save and retain all the legitimation section parameters. we would need a requirement to implement this clearly;;;",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

DXL must call another API “searchPromotions” from Bluemarble to resolve the promotions as well.

We now have several areas that need to be adjusted, and these will not be completed before 26.10.2025.

Unfortunately, it is not possible to manually remove mandatory discounts and fees by the agent in OSF and thus avoid the error.

This blocks most of the planned tests and cannot be solved via a workaround.;;;","05/Oct/25 6:33 PM;ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com;Change will be tested with Wave 10.2 release;;;",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

GLS discontinued its GLSIDENT service some time ago (months ago). For security reasons, we didn't immediately deactivate it in Prod, but instead made it ""unselectable"" via PriceRange adjustments. It was finally deactivated now (in Prod and Test). Unfortunately, the PriceRange in Test hadn't been adjusted at the time, so since yesterday, the old service for items up to €600 hasn't been available, only new services. We've now corrected the PriceRange in Test as well, and an old service is being returned via the GASO.;;;",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

*Please note:*
 # The bug appears also on ACC1 and ACC3
 # Please check this Epic: OAF-598 CR794 - UM: Desired Delivery Date (""Lieferoption Wunschtermin"") - Vodafone Global Jira maybe it is related to that

 

+Actual Result:+ STRING is not allowed for Desired Delivery Date for Cable

+Steps to reproduce:+
 * load a Cable address on ACC2, e. g.: ""Hagelstangestr. 30, 81927 München""
 * click on ""Paket hinzufügen  >> Kabel Internet & Phone"" 
 * select any KIP tariff, e.g.: ""[2BV:N12] GigaZuhause 500 Kabel, 1.-12. Monat 19,99 € ""
 * continue with the Order until the Delivery Details
 * select the value ""Datum Lieferung"" in the field ""Wunschtermin auswählen""

Ticketcreator: pavanraj.chappa1
Hi Tech-M Team,
 
Steps to reproduce -
1.Login in to Telesales
2.Add any Cable tarif and hardware
3.Go for the checkout
4.In the delivery option section, enter a manual disabled wish date in the input field, system is allowing for the checkout except weekends.
 
Expected behaviour : The system should not allow to enter disabled wish date manually. It should be validated.
 
 
========================================================
 
Hi Sardar/Team,
 
As discussed, Please find the attached screenshots.
 
Issue Desc: Wishdate should only be selectable via calendar
 
It should not be possible to fill in a date manually in the field „TT.MM.JJJJ” (orange) because it is possible to type in certain dates which are greyed out in the calendar (green). It should only be possible to select a date from the calendar by clicking on a date.
 
Kindly check and if any details needed kindly let me know.
 
Br,
Pavanraj Chappa

Betreff: Unity Wunschtermin - Datumsangabe
 
Hello 
I would like to request that a ticket be opened for the selection of a desired date for Unitymedia (CR794).
 
Currently the CR is still on ACC2, but the CR will be imported into the production environment on 19.03.2025 and there it will most likely behave in the same way as on the test environment.
 
It is possible to enter a date manually for the Unitymedia requested date:
 
 
 
 
I would like to ask that the field for the date specification (marked green) can only be filled in by selecting a date in the calendar (marked pink) if the value “Date delivery” (marked turquoise) is selected in the “Select desired date” field:
 
 
 
 
 
The field for the date specification (green) should not be writable.
 
Best regards
 
Nora
 
===============================================
Hallo 
ich möchte darum bitten, dass ein Ticket für die Auswahl eines Wunschtermins für Unitymedia (CR794) geöffnet wird.
 
Aktuell liegt der CR noch auf ACC2, allerdings wird der CR am 19.03.2025 in die Produktionsumgebung eingespielt und dort wird es sich mit hoher Wahrscheinlichkeit genauso verhalten wie auf der Testumgebung.
 
Für den Unitymedia Wunschtermin ist es möglich, dass ein Datum manuell eingetragen werden kann:
 
 
 
 
Ich möchte darum bitten, dass das Feld für die Datumsangabe (grün markiert) ausschließlich über die Auswahl eines Datums im Kalender (pink markiert) gefüllt werden kann, wenn im Feld ""Wunschtermin auswählen"" der Wert ""Datum Lieferung"" (türkis markiert) ausgewählt ist:
 
 
 
 
 
Das Feld für die Datumsangabe (grün) soll nicht beschreibbar sein.
 
Viele Grüße
 
Nora

We have reviewed the IT COM application logs and found no issues or errors. Additionally, the connectivity to ITEFFONLDB is functioning as expected.

We also verified the OGG replication, which is operating smoothly without any lag.

However, since new orders continue to get stuck at state 1472 in COMDB, the issue has been highlighted to POSFE Team for further investigation.

We will update you once we get any inputs from them.;;;","19/Sep/25 2:42 PM;alka.kshirsagar2@vodafone.com;Retest is blocked due to [OS-77585] OSF | Wave 10.1 | ACC2 | DSL/FTTH old tariffs are descoped & new portfolio is activated in IT environment - Vodafone Global Jira;;;","19/Sep/25 3:16 PM;yogesh.borade1@vodafone.com;Please update below comments in the same defect:
 
We have received below inputs from POSFE Team addressing the issue:
It seems there had been some client related problems to reach it. In these cases always try to restart the session – maybe it will solve the problem.
 
If some order does not reach COM, please check the order in POS-FE and check for its state.
 
Has it been imported?   (Have other orders been imported?)
If  only some orders have not been imported – it could be because the barcode had been used once before.
Reason why it is not visible  could be also: cpcom agent + Import Auftrag agent have not run, the corresponding POSDB / EFFONL database had not been available during at run time.
Is there any clearing required?  If yes -  the order cannot be sent to other systems -> you need to solve that problems first.
As there are several agents running in the database – one execution of an agent,  consuming a long processing time  will lead to delay of execution of others.
Sometimes a lost Oracle connection could also prevent some agent to finish in time or get it stuck – then a restart of the system might be necessary.
 
For the given barcodes  they have been imported by need clearing – the chosen tariff seems to be expired! (not allowed for customer contracts signed after 15.9.2025)

SignoSign has not changed and to say it in short words: this is no feasible workaround for production and OM must be fixed before your launch.

 

The reason is that the document identification must always be in white colour in size >0 pt in footer of first page, it must never be visible or made visible, shop representative can even not click in adobe reader and especially not for every such contract summary.

 

SignoSign was working fine with the 'white on white' identification in footer before. Since OM has changed and it's not working anymore, OM must be corrected to solve the issue.

1) possible solution is under test on CGI side, fix cannot be delivered before 6th of October. Change cannot be rolled back, as the format has to fulfill Barrierefreiheit restrictions

2) Predocument will be shared with Ursula so she can check if signosign is able to handle it already this week

I have asked everyone involved at OM to support the process as best they can so that you can start testing sooner.

 

The plan: RFA will be submitted on October 2 at 10 a.m., which means the software would be available for testing from noon onwards.

 

But we will decide on September 30 at 3 p.m. whether the test can stick to this plan. if further errors are found, we will return to the old plan (RFA on October 6).

Hi Satish/Ajay ,

Based on further analysis we can see the package created is Postpaid and the product selected is Sim-Only Tariff. In this case the package does not contain any product which belongs to *NoIdent → catagory.* If at least one product on package belongs to *NoIdent* category we will send NoIdentFlag as Y else N.

Below is the detail from US:

IF *ALL the mobile postpaid ACQ / MIGCOC package(s) contain at least one products of the category ""NoIdent""* (OS-961), then the system sets the boolean NoIdentFlag to 'Y', else to 'N'

It is working as expected. If still reporter has concerns lets arrange call and discuss over call;;;","18/Sep/25 1:38 PM;satish.dhere1@vodafone.com;[~bharath.krishnamurthy@vodafone.com]

Hi Satish ,

Kindly find the below details which will give more details on why NewNoIdent is shown for above scenario.

!462eab32-0917-4ce0-9731-d504bf04da04.png!

Above scenario is falling under 2 point on above Screenshot.

 

Customer is new and the package in cart package does not contain any product which belongs to *NoIdent → catagory* so NoIdentFlag is N which further if the ""noIdentFlag"" is ""N"" then the OGW returns list of IdentMethods(all EXISTING ident methods)

So this is an expected behavior.

As per the discussion with TechM Team, Current SIM only products are not categories under NoIdent due to which Omnius is sending NoIdentFlag as N in GetIdent request towards OGW, As a result we can see other than NoNewIdent identification methods in identification section retrieved from OGW for sim only product, Could you please check and confirm, Is this expected behavior or This should be fixed by PCAT Team ?

Hi [~sura.radha1@vodafone.com] [~nasir.sayyad@vodafone.com] 

CR907 scope is for Private customer
The mentioned customer is SOHO so according to existing logic the ILS button will be disabled
So this is not a valid defect

*Existing situation:*

*ILS button*
IF DunningStatus = IN_DUNNING
THEN ILS button is disabled
ELSE ILS button is enabled

*VVL check button (banner with button) i.e. section ""VVL prüfen"".*
IF (DunningStatus = IN_DUNNING OR CustomerStatus = D) AND current contract > 18 month
THEN VVL is allowed
ELSEIF (DunningStatus = IN_DUNNING OR CustomerStatus = D) AND current contract < 18 month
THEN VVLcheck (banner+button) is hidden
ELSE 
VVL is allowed
h3. As per CR907

*ILS button and VVL check button*

IF (DunningStatus = IN_DUNNING OR CollectionDelinquentStatus = D) AND CustomerStatus = S/N
THEN ILS button disabled AND VVL check (banner+button) not show
ELSE ILS button enabled AND VVL check (banner+button) is shown

[~silpa.nanda2@vodafone.com] We have checked the log and observe that the gigakombi request is not triggered as it is failing at before step which is getting the auth token.
Please note first auth token request is triggered ,once you get successful bearer token then using that we trigger gigakombi eligibility request.

As it is failing at auth token ,the respective error message related to auth token will be displayed

please refer https://jira.sp.vodafone.com/browse/OS-58148

This issue seems to be related to the PST bug: [[PSTBUG-3509] PAPI | OSF | VKD,VFW | All orders are failing with Delivery & Billing address error message - DE Jira|https://de.jira.agile.vodafone.com/browse/PSTBUG-3509]

Answer from developer:

Hello,
The issue is in IBP (IRIS) when it contacts AdsFacade to validate the sent addresses. The exact field causing the issue is houseNumberAddition. When the field is omitted in the request, AdsFacade returns an asterisk in the candidate addresses. When the address is compared with the candidate address returned from AdsFacade, the validation fails (becasue null != '*'). 
A workaround can be applied in IRIS to ignore asterisks in both the address and the candidate address when comparing them as it's already a wildcard.

Hi [~ajay.yashwantbhavar@vodafone.com] [~silpa.nanda2@vodafone.com] 

There is one remark: if you providing folder screenshots please copy not only files list but also the complete path to these files.


Lets consider KD_935317885 Customer as we have the complete screenshot\logs case.
According to the logs, zip file attached, OSE has successfully called OGW RetrieveCustomerInfo service and got the response back. 
I assumed that either one more service has been called after this having timeout or FE cant retrieve service result in correct way.

May I ask you to reply:
1. What has been changed recently? (OSE\ OIL \ other app deployments)

Hi Ari/Siddhi/Gagan,

It might not be reproducible in Production Env also
 
and in LNP Env we don't have enough data to replicate, but we have given as a work around on this issue
 
so agent will have the *'NO_PRELOAD_ORDERS'* enabled for his profile , so he should ideally not face this issue 
 
also 90 to 95 % user have this option, which get 30 records in 2 to 3 second  

Note:

Due to this performance issue this option{*}'NO_PRELOAD_ORDERS'{*} was added long back
 

 ;;;","01/Oct/25 6:39 PM;ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com;[~gagan.patkar@vodafone.com]  can you compare if your role is different related to permissions in ACC1. 2 and 3?

I’ve connected with Ajay from the Functional Testing team and confirmed that we’re all using the same agent role: {*}Back Office Agent{*}.

From the {*}ACC2 last release (W9.2){*}, we observed that the *Open Manager page load time for orders* has increased significantly. Previously, it averaged {*}16 to 8 seconds{*}, but it’s now taking {*}over 40 seconds{*}.

The *TID team* has confirmed that the *cron job for order cleanup* is running daily and is removing orders older than {*}90 days{*}.

Additionally, I spoke with *Yogesh from the TEMS team* and tested the {{""NO_PRELOAD_ORDERS""}} permission for the Back Office Agent. We confirmed that enabling this option prevents any records from loading. However, as per {*}Bharat’s input{*}, it should ideally load {*}30 records{*}. Therefore, this option {*}should not be considered a valid mitigation or solution{*}.

Please find the attached snapshot for reference.

Overview/Description

Due to legal reasons, Omnius is only allowed to display orders for 90 days after they reached status 'completed' in the order manager. After this time span, they should not be shown anymore. Also, we should be able to delete orders with a certain status after a certain submission date. 

Seems CLI script is not working as expected as I can see older than 90 days orders are visible in Order Manager.

Hi Siddhi/Gagan,
 
This script is designed to delete records only for the following statuses. All other statuses will remain unaffected.
The deletion is governed by back-office settings, which currently permit the removal of records older than 90 days for the statuses listed below:

OrderCompletedSuccessfully
OrderCompletedWithCancellation
OrderCompletedWithFailure
OrderInProgressWithFailure

Please let me know if you need any further clarification.

Hi Maheedhar,
 
Kindly verify Customer test data : 

1. MODE1 logs for correct customertype information.
2. GetLegacySearch for correct customertype information.

Values should be : 
+SOHO PRIVATE+ 
CustomerType - S 
CustomerSubType - PRIVATE / RVPRIVATE 

+SOHO RVPRIVATE+ 
CustomerType - S 
CustomerSubType - RVPRIVATE 

PS: CustomerType -S means SOHO 

*A. Legacy customer should have correct values of customer type & customer subtype*

*!image-2025-09-03-17-20-54-136.png!*
{{<CustomerType>S</CustomerType>}}
 
 {{<CustomerSubType>PRIVATE</CustomerSubType>}}
 
*B. Similarly the same customer type should be reflected in MODE1 logs* 
{{!image-2025-09-03-17-22-28-126.png!}}

the customer should have customerSubType but the attached customer logs has missing customerSubType

Hi [~nasir.sayyad@vodafone.com]  [~ajay.yashwantbhavar@vodafone.com] 

As this CR907 demand was requested to allow sales flow for such customer in dunning/ delinquent status , 
and based on this incident we understood such customer Omnius doesn’t received Orderline details. 
Due to Agent can’t any proceed with sales flow activity because of missing orderline details.

this is not a defect.
Basically this looks like a gap in demand, need to verify with VF (Thorsten/Andreas) requester for this CR907.;;;","03/Sep/25 6:29 PM;nina.pickl@vodafone.com;Hi [~nasir.sayyad@vodafone.com], could you please check the same use case on ACC1 and share the results?

As per TechM analysis,

OGW is not sending required data in getCustomer details, hence assigning this defect to OGW.

As this CR907 demand was requested to allow sales flow for such customer in dunning/ delinquent status ,
and based on this incident we understood such customer Omnius doesn’t received Orderline details.

In OGW, there's a validation that triggers Mode-2 service calls only when the subscriberStatus is {*}""A""{*}. For the BANs mentioned in the comment below, the *SearchCustomerBANSubscriberResponse* is returning subscriberStatus as {*}""S""{*}, which results in an empty response. Can you please check with the KIAS team regarding this specific customer.

If yes, then the customer is corrupted, because in the GMY1 Tariff Option, the SOC SO_EL_SIM is not allowed.

If no, maybe OGW is adding a soc before changing the tariff, which leads to an error during wrong order.;;;","01/Sep/25 7:21 PM;ajay.yashwantbhavar@vodafone.com;Hi [~kevin.broeggelwirth@vodafone.com], This SO_EL_SIM is added in submit order request from PCAT, Please check below details:

In Theory at first the tariff has to be changed, and then the SOC has to be added, otherwise it fails, because the SOC is not allowed in the current tariff option. Need to be analyzed by AMDOCs.;;;","01/Sep/25 7:45 PM;ajay.yashwantbhavar@vodafone.com;As per the PCAT Team's investigation, Assigning ticket to OGW Team.

The order of calling the ADD SOC Request after Tariff Change is correctly followed by OGW. However I see that the changeTariff call was not successful and we received an error ""EAI000039  Unspecified application error. Please contact system support. "" from EAI. Can you please check with EAI Team regarding this error. PFB changeTariff Request for your reference:

is not working as expected. For more details see OS-76802. 

Basically, the rule with operation ‘EQL(1)’ should ensure that when moving to the extended shopping cart in an ACQ Prepaid package, exactly one product from {_}‘{_}{_}Mobile->Prepaid_Blister_Retail’{_} should be in the package if the agent belongs to a certain OSE channel.

We also tried it in a slightly different approach using a restriction to the channel ""Retail"" - with same effect:

This rule does functionally something else than a ‘not allowed’ rule which simply make sure certain products are not shown in the configurator.

As the rule does functionality something else than described before, then this behavior  seems to be a defect and needs to be fixed. It is an essential rule for ""Prepaid in Retail"" in wave 10.1

Hi [Thomas Wermke, Vodafone (External)|https://jira.sp.vodafone.com/secure/ViewProfile.jspa?name=thomas.wermke%40vodafone.com],

The rule defined below is applicable for both the channels(telesales and retail).

PFA
 * As a result, the rule functionality is working correctly and displays the appropriate warning message as configured.

 * Agent *apart from* 'Fachhandel,Filiale,Partneragentur' ose channel *mapping* should be used for *Telesales* as products from *Prepaid_Blister_Retail* will not be listed for telesales (again based on the comp rules).

 * Agent *from* 'Fachhandel,Filiale,Partneragentur' ose channel *mapping* should be used for *Retail* as products from *Prepaid_Blister_Retail* will be listed for Retail(again based on the comp rules).

 * Hence if we use the correct agent we don't face the issue. we checked along with Natasa and it worked on ACC2 as well. 

 * As per rule, the blister product added to the shopping cart does not belong to the Prepaid_Blister_Retail category.

 * The only issue we encountered is cache-related: when the agent changes the redSalesId, the system retains the old product cache. We will address and fix this caching issue.;;;","01/Sep/25 6:53 PM;thomas.wermke@vodafone.com;In PCAT-INT sandbox the rule seems to operate well, too.

it is based more or less on a misunderstanding about the different PCAT setups for Telesales and Retail scenarios.

1. The purpose of the affected PCAT Compatibility Rule is to force an agent/user belonging to a Retail sales channel to select an sku from the category of retail blister(i.e. a SIM card item or eSIM cardboard card physically available in the shop).

2. During test execution, a clear distinction must be made between the agent’s affiliation with a particular sales channel and the login process on the respective Telesales or Retail websites.

3. Unfortunately the above mentioned rule cannot be restricted to the webite ""Retail"". Instead it evaluates the agent’s affiliation with a particular sales channel.

4. The current Prepaid product configuration in PCAT for Telesales restricts tariff selection to the predefined set of Telesales-specific SKUs (formatted as 'Kso' + <KIAS-TO-code>). Upon selection, a corresponding SIM/blister/item is automatically added to the shopping cart in a one-to-one relationship. Manual selection of alternative products or tariffs by the user is not permitted in this flow. After checkout, the order is transmitted to SAP, which initiates the dispatch of a pre-activated SIM card to the customer via mail.
 
5. The updated Prepaid product setup in PCAT for Retail enables the selection of both a blister item and a tariff from the available set of Retail tariffs (SKUs formatted as 'K' + <KIAS-TO-code>). Typically, the user first selects a blister item, after which a default tariff —usually the one printed on the packaging and defined in the KIAS table PREPAID_PACKAGE for the selected item_id— is automatically pre-selected. The user then has the option to deselect and change this default tariff and choose an alternative from the list of available tariffs, as defined in the KIAS table ACTIVATION_SETTINGS for the selected item_id. Upon checkout, the retail agent hands the blister/SIM to the customer, and the order is transmitted to the KIAS backend for subscriber activation. Especially in this scenario, it is important to use PCAT rules to force the user to select a blister and a tariff before checkout. 

-> Telesales user/sales id should belong to a Telesales channel (not the website) and a blister item is added automatically to the shopping cart after tariff selection.
Retail user/sales id should belong to a Retail channel (Filiale, Fachhandel, Partneragentur) and a tariff is preselected after blister selection.Manual choice of a blister is mandatory.

Hi Ajay,

I checked further over code we are checking both OSE and Non OSE open orders to disable the Debit to Credit button.

*OSE open Order:* On OSE side if the customer don't have any order (Orders with status not equal to ‘{{{}SO_COMPLETED_SUCCESS{}}}, {{{}SO_COMPLETED_FAILED{}}}, {{{}SO_COMPLETED_WITH_CANCELLATION{}}}' and package with status not equal '{{{}OnHold-PendingOnlineIdentSignDoc{}}}, {{{}OnHold-PendingOnlineIdentification{}}}’ if all these conditions are met and results found then we treat it as OSE open Order)

*Non OSE Open Order:* If in mode logs we check if customer has any{{{}PendingOrder{}}}info node to decide on non ose open order.

If we don't find any results on both then we consider customer don't have an open order and Wechsel Debit to Credit button is enabled;;;","01/Sep/25 2:34 PM;ajay.yashwantbhavar@vodafone.com;Hi [~thorsten.lehnert@vodafone.com] [~andreas.baldermann@vodafone.com]

Mobile_Hardware file gets the data from two table

1- OPM_HARDWARE -> this for the data in the UI

2- PREP_HARDWARE -> AKA SAP HARDWARE, and this is for the SAP data

 

the table PREP_HARDWARE which contains the SAP data, it doesn't have a column called ""Estimated_delivery_date"" at all, so when we actually exporting the Sap data from prep hardware we set the value of the ""Estimated_delivery_date"" from the article No entity linked to this PREP hardware entity.

+*so, the ""Estimated_delivery_date"" can be empty in two cases*+

1- this sap hardware isn't linked to article no *(Not the case looking at the file)*

2- the article no linked to this sap hardware has an empty *Estimated_delivery_date* value

 

I ran a query on ACC to check the second case and it actually prove there are no values

!image-2025-09-02-16-09-00-724.png|width=711,height=286!

this is on wave 10.1 release

So I believe we need to check

1- If this is really related to the empty Estimated_delivery_date from OSF side, as PAPS team we cant verify this.

2- If it is the case then the users might want to look why the article has empty Estimated_delivery_date fields.;;;","02/Sep/25 7:23 PM;ajay.yashwantbhavar@vodafone.com;[~gaurav.lanjewar1@vodafone.com] Could you please setup a call for this issue with VF PCAT, PAPS and SAP Team.;;;","05/Sep/25 6:01 PM;gaurav.lanjewar1@vodafone.com;Hi [~ajay.yashwantbhavar@vodafone.com] call is scheduled for Monday 8th September.;;;","08/Sep/25 4:34 PM;gaurav.lanjewar1@vodafone.com;Hi All, As discussed in the call,

Cause : The issue has come due to php upgradation. The error occurred because $values['endPeriod'] was an empty string, and PHP 8 does not allow arithmetic operations between a string and an integer.

In PHP 8, type handling is stricter. If $values['endPeriod'] is an empty string (''), subtracting an integer from it ('' - $monthDiff) is not allowed, resulting in a fatal error.




$result = (max(($values['endPeriod'] - $monthDiff), 0)) ?: $values['endPeriod'];
Fix: To resolve the issue, the value was explicitly cast to an integer before performing the subtraction.

 [~ajay.yashwantbhavar@vodafone.com]  has checked in codes and I have checked the old HLD documents with @Kshitij Kumar Srivastava's help. This is a very old implementation of hiding the nationality field for VVL cases. Since it is an old implementation, we unfortunately do not have external ID.
If this must be changed, it should be a SRT.

Hi [~ajay.yashwantbhavar@vodafone.com] 

The ticket reference OAF-521 is about to the visible dropdown over UI, beyond the existing condition to show the nationality dropdown that must shown in mandatory format with not default option preset and must show Germany is first option.

So this OAF-521 is not justifying to show Nationality dropdown in VVL case. *So this is not a valid defect.*

 

hope this help.

As per design in VVL use case for mobile this dropdown will not shown. ref HLD SS is already given.;;;","30/Aug/25 5:36 PM;ajay.yashwantbhavar@vodafone.com;Hi [~vikash.saurav@vodafone.com] [~kshitij.srivastava1@vodafone.com]

As seen in the codes there is an explicit condition for SOHO + VVL to not show the Nationality field. It is an old implementation from 2017.

i can see from agent status table info both these agents have last logged in before couple of months the season we are getting this msg access blocked is due to threshold value from BO you can verify from acc BO

!image-2025-09-02-14-58-27-873.png!

 

in actual we should get this msg 

!image-2025-09-02-15-03-45-614.png!

I suspect the reason is in agent table reasonsuspensionid value is Array

!image-2025-09-02-15-08-39-472.png!

need to find out why this is setting to array please help to get below data:

As discussed with Shrikrishna, we currently do not have the required access for this agent configuration. We have therefore requested with the IXc team (Sneha) to assist with the necessary details.

Regarding the issue, we are facing challenges with users that were created earlier (OLD) either via NGUM or manually.;;;","03/Sep/25 12:39 PM;ashutosh.chavan@vodafone.com;Hello [~bharath.krishnamurthy@vodafone.com] 

As requested, Sneha has provided the BO System Configuration details for analysis. Following this, Shrikrushna identified that the access block was caused by the threshold value set to 42 days.
To resolve the issue, we already attempted to unblock the user from the back office by performing actions such as unlocking the account and resetting the password. However, the issue remains unresolved.
Shrikrushna needs to investigate further to determine how we can successfully unblock these user accounts.;;;","12/Sep/25 10:38 AM;bharath.krishnamurthy@vodafone.com;[~ashutosh.chavan@vodafone.com] [~yogesh.borade1@vodafone.com]

This CR896 is not for Techm(Omnius) , this is Amdocs CR.

 

Where in e2e flow test team wanted to test a particular usecase for salesflow having agent with role (business function)  B2B_TELESALES_OL_AGENT_NOCS

 

where it found this role doesn't exist in Omnius s/w.

 

*Conclusion: delivery of Role data is not part of Omnius software delivery*

 

Hint : creation of role in Omnius can be done via 2 ways.
 #  Omnius gets the Role data via nGUM (multiple end points) - must be check with VF user management
 # maunally manupulation of data via backoffice
 #  

So, this is not an issue, its an configuration topic.

Hi Ajay/Nasir ,

Based on further analysis we come to know that the customer we facing this issue is not having complete mode information like mode 1 having no proper response data, followed by mode 2 and mode 3.

Due to this missing mode response details this edge case scenario occurred where customer 360 is not having complete information to call further link potential customers and land into above UI.

Here we need to check why customer mode logs are not complete and to fix this edge case we need to have call with design team on correct UI on this case.;;;","25/Aug/25 6:57 PM;ajay.yashwantbhavar@vodafone.com;As discussed, Logs attached [~bharath.krishnamurthy@vodafone.com] ;;;","25/Aug/25 8:34 PM;bharath.krishnamurthy@vodafone.com;[~ajay.yashwantbhavar@vodafone.com]

We have observed that PCAT rules are blocking the flow to move ahead from extended shopping cart. This rule needs to be removed for unblocking Telesales by PCAT-Team for ACC 2

This also had undesirable effects on telesales.

The purpose of this rule, specifically in retail, is to force the agent to add a product (here: a prepaid blister pack) from a specific category (here: the set of all available prepaid blister packs) to the shopping cart before checking out.

At this point, we need a proposal from TechM for implementing this requirement.;;;","30/Aug/25 7:52 PM;ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com;Blocked by [OS-77100] PCAT comp rule with operation ""EQL(1)"" does not operate as expected - Vodafone Global Jira;;;","01/Sep/25 10:47 AM;bharath.krishnamurthy@vodafone.com;[~natasa.dimovic1@vodafone.com] [~ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com] [~thomas.wermke@vodafone.com]

Hi Natasa,

This is coming for telesales as the rule is applicable for telesales also if we are not using a right agent.

 ;;;","05/Sep/25 4:07 PM;natasa.dimovic1@vodafone.com;On Monday (8th of September) we have a meeting together with [~thomas.wermke@vodafone.com] ;;;","08/Sep/25 3:04 PM;thomas.wermke@vodafone.com;Todays meeting with TechM and ACC-Team revealed that this issue is NO bug.
it is based more or less on a misunderstanding about the different PCAT setups for Telesales and Retail scenarios.

1. The purpose of the affected PCAT Compatibility Rule is to force an agent/user belonging to a Retail sales channel to select an sku from the category of retail blister(i.e. a SIM card item or eSIM cardboard card physically available in the shop).

2. During test execution, a clear distinction must be made between the agent’s affiliation with a particular sales channel and the login process on the respective Telesales or Retail websites.

3. Unfortunately the above mentioned rule cannot be restricted to the webite ""Retail"". Instead it evaluates the agent’s affiliation with a particular sales channel.

4. The current Prepaid product configuration in PCAT for Telesales restricts tariff selection to the predefined set of Telesales-specific SKUs (formatted as 'Kso' + <KIAS-TO-code>). Upon selection, a corresponding SIM/blister/item is automatically added to the shopping cart in a one-to-one relationship. Manual selection of alternative products or tariffs by the user is not permitted in this flow. After checkout, the order is transmitted to SAP, which initiates the dispatch of a pre-activated SIM card to the customer via mail.
 
5. The updated Prepaid product setup in PCAT for Retail enables the selection of both a blister item and a tariff from the available set of Retail tariffs (SKUs formatted as 'K' + <KIAS-TO-code>). Typically, the user first selects a blister item, after which a default tariff —usually the one printed on the packaging and defined in the KIAS table PREPAID_PACKAGE for the selected item_id— is automatically pre-selected. The user then has the option to deselect and change this default tariff and choose an alternative from the list of available tariffs, as defined in the KIAS table ACTIVATION_SETTINGS for the selected item_id. Upon checkout, the retail agent hands the blister/SIM to the customer, and the order is transmitted to the KIAS backend for subscriber activation. Especially in this scenario, it is important to use PCAT rules to force the user to select a blister and a tariff before checkout. 

-> Telesales user/sales id should belong to a Telesales channel (not the website) and a blister item is added automatically to the shopping cart after tariff selection.
Retail user/sales id should belong to a Retail channel (Filiale, Fachhandel, Partneragentur) and a tariff is preselected after blister selection.Manual choice of a blister is mandatory.

-> Tickets OS-77100, OS-76802, OS-76950 should be rejected and cancelled.;;;","08/Sep/25 3:23 PM;natasa.dimovic1@vodafone.com;Works as designed – > see previous comment from [~thomas.wermke@vodafone.com]

Disabling/Enabling the VIP did not make a difference.

Sorry, but I have to reject support by pointing to alternatives: 

- I cannot access that ticket, so I don't know the details.
- The last time the error was status 500, not 503, so this might be triggered by something else.
- I don't usually deal with OSF systems, I am just knowledable about PHP, which was the source of the problem last time, and I coordinated a fix with the correct maintainers.

If you suspect the PHAR file is wrong and creates an issue, get in touch with BBTV Team Tag, and Osama Said, Vodafone specifically. They do maintain the delivery.
 
And again I suggest to hand over maintenance of this API layer to the OSF vendor, as it will create more issues in the future if versions and interfaces don't match across all software elements they deliver. ;;;","07/Aug/25 6:50 PM;atharva.paskanthi@vodafone.com;Hi [~vikash.saurav@vodafone.com] , is TechM confirm that it is something related to phar file and not like other 503 internal server errors ??

wir haben [OMART-466|https://nam12.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fde.jira.agile.vodafone.com%2Fbrowse%2FOMART-466&data=05%7C02%7Cnorbert.forai%40dxc.com%7Cd624ef0bfba24639d87208ddc6027487%7C93f33571550f43cfb09fcd331338d086%7C0%7C0%7C638884436496987768%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJFbXB0eU1hcGkiOnRydWUsIlYiOiIwLjAuMDAwMCIsIlAiOiJXaW4zMiIsIkFOIjoiTWFpbCIsIldUIjoyfQ%3D%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&sdata=7%2Fh9LoRc%2BK8CfdKGLgws8si%2BqhXqbJgAKG2sbeLrgf0%3D&reserved=0] weiter untersucht und festgestellt, dass die Ursache des Problems darin liegt, dass in der zweiten „PackageConfiguration” vom Typ TV der Knoten „CommercialProducts“ fehlt.

Laut omogw.xsd sollte unter einem PackageConfiguration Knoten mindestens ein Knoten „CommercialProducts“ vorhanden sein.

!image-2025-07-23-20-45-15-966.png!

Sobald mindestens ein Knoten „CommercialProducts“ hinzugefügt wurde, treten keine Probleme bei der Verarbeitung auf (siehe Anhang).

*Wir haben auch die Testdaten überprüft, die dem Produktionsvorfall INC000094827316 beigefügt waren. Dort besteht das gleiche Problem.*

*Da es sich um ein Problem mit den Eingabedaten handelt, sollte im Eingabesystem geprüft werden, warum das System diese Informationen in diesem Szenario nicht an OM weiterleitet.*

FYI: die zweite PackageConfiguration  Knoten kann entfernt werden. Es funktioniert ebenfalls einwandfrei, sofern die erste PackageConfiguration  für TV die aktuellen Details nach der Änderung enthält.

OM is saying that the cause of the issue is that the ""CommercialProducts"" node is missing in the second ""PackageConfiguration"" of type TV.

We observe that only below tag is sending from Omnius side and OGW side

 ;;;","25/Jul/25 5:37 PM;affan.baragazi@vodafone.com;Hi [~natasa.dimovic1@vodafone.com] ,

OGW includes *CommercialProducts* in a package only when the *LineActivityType* in the *CommercialDetails* (received in the SubmitOrder request from Omnius) is not ""{*}REFUSE{*}"" or ""{*}DROP{*}"", and the *ScopeList* contains a Scope with the value ""{*}Contract{*}"".

For the second package, such CommercialDetails are missing, which is why OGW does not add any CommercialProducts to it.

PFB for reference:

Hi [~natasa.dimovic1@vodafone.com] 

We did further analysis and got to know that RetrieveDocument Service we called when we clicked the Drucken (Second button on flow) there is some error response received. Due to which the document is not opened.

Which means on OSE there is no issue we need to check with OGW on why we have the problematic response on this flow.

Kindly reject and assign to OGW

The error mentioned in the below comment is valid. OGW is returning it because we haven't yet received a callback from OM for that specific document.

As mentioned earlier as well, OGW includes *CommercialProducts* in a package only when the *LineActivityType* in the *CommercialDetails* (received in the SubmitOrder request from Omnius) is not ""{*}REFUSE{*}"" or ""{*}DROP{*}"", and the *ScopeList* contains a Scope with the value ""{*}Contract{*}"".

For the second package with SkuID {*}SN3{*}, these conditions still appear to be unmet, which is why OGW does not add the CommercialProducts to it.

In LNP we do not see any performance issue, Retrieve customer is working as expected.

The response times are similar to Wave 9.1 and wave 9.2 baseline, hence this is issue specifically for ACC environment and not related to performance of the application. Please find the below evidence from LNP environment ->

Please provide more info:
 - why it should be a Portals Impact because so far only RNS, OM and OSF are involved?

+[~nina.pickl@vodafone.com] ;;;","06/Jun/25 5:36 PM;nina.pickl@vodafone.com;[~anton.ustimenko@vodafone.com] , also VKD is involved, Unity can only communicate with OSF via VKD.

The flow is as follow:  cancellation reason ist trasferred from Unity vo VDK, afterwards VKD is trasferring the reason to OGW/OSF.

If OSF  is not getting the Info from VKD, the reason can not be displayed in OSF.

So the issue is between Unity and VKD and this change was already tested from your side. You can create a Defect against Unity, related to this test task: [[QA] OSF/VKD Gateway/Minerva Adapter - Adjustments Order Manager - Portals - Vodafone DE Confluence|https://de.confluence.agile.vodafone.com/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=599719049];;;","06/Jun/25 6:39 PM;anton.ustimenko@vodafone.com;Ok.

This feature is actually: [[DISPYRAMID-217] Adapt VKDGateway to pass through new order details - DE Jira|https://de.jira.agile.vodafone.com/browse/DISPYRAMID-217] should implement this.

Just for your understanding the root cause:

the cancellation as self seems to be working fine and this is working without Portals systems. RNS communicate in this case directly with OSF systems.

By displaying of information in OM the OSF accessing MinervaAdapter via VkdGateway. And here is probably the issue. I addressed it to team Pyramid as they implemented the extension for cancellation codes in April release 2025.

*Ahmed ElZahaby, Vodafone (Team Pyramid) added a comment -*

I've looked in it, it seems like it's caused because the declined reason isn't founded in the enums that defined in StatusDetails in UnityOrderTracker, so the flow here we 've created an isCancellationReason:

https://webgit.kabeldeutschland.de/projects/LUAAUTO/repos/unityordertracker/browse/UnityOrderTrackerScheduler/src/main/java/com/vodafone/cable/uotracker/updater/data/StatusDetail.java#254-256

That function checks if the order status that returned from MinervaAdaptor exists in CANCELLATION_REASON_MAP value and if it's not it set it with null:

https://webgit.kabeldeutschland.de/projects/LUAAUTO/repos/unityordertracker/browse/UnityOrderTrackerScheduler/src/main/java/com/vodafone/cable/uotracker/updater/vkdgateway/VkdGatewayOrderStatusUpdater.java?at=24d5d4b6d127bf5feee0bb99d80f3f74a73fc7df#63-66

And after I've search for the provided cancellation reason ''STORNO VORVERMARKTUNG'' ('CANCELLATION PRE-MARKETING') I didn't find it in the CANCELLATION_REASON_MAP values.

So, my suggested solution here if the team who is ever responsible for UnityOrderTracker just need to add that cancellation reason into the enums it has in StatusDetails.;;;","13/Jun/25 12:13 PM;atharva.paskanthi@vodafone.com;*Update on PSTBUG*

[~anton.ustimenko@vodafone.com] ,Before I can move forward, I need access to OSF to identify the specific API being called to retrieve the cancellation reason. That step is essential to pinpoint where the issue is occurring and determine whether it’s within our scope.

The OSF team should be able to clarify which API is involved and where the issue lies — their input will help direct the next steps effectively.

We found the place in the VKD logs, where the cancellation reason=cancellation eventCode should be present, but it is missing.

Means the value of the Order Manager field ""STATUS_DETAIL"" is NOT present in the VKD Gateway logs for SOME cancellation reasons.

*Unity is not sending this code via Minera to VKD.* 

Like discussed in the beginning, someone from Cable team should create a Bug for Minerva and Unity team can check the cancellations reasons code table again.

The Unity change was implemented an year ago, maybe in the meantime some new cancellation reasons were added and they the table should now be updated.

 

VKD Log for the NOT working cancellation reason ‚Storno Vorvermarktung':

 

""statusInfos"" : [#012    \{#012      ""statusType"" : ""VALUE"",#012      ""system"" : ""cable"",#012    ""eventCode"" : ""CUSTOMER_ID"",#012      ""eventPresentationText"" : ""new cable customer id 173663507"",#012      ""eventValue"" : ""173663507""#012    }#  +*{color:#de350b}***MISSING PART***{color}*+

 

As example, for other reasons like 'double order', the value is present in the logs and it is also trasferregd from VKD to OSF, is working fine:

 

""statusInfos"" : [#012    \{#012      ""statusType"" : ""VALUE"",#012      ""system"" : ""cable"",#012      ""eventCode"" : ""CUSTOMER_ID"",#012      ""eventPresentationText"" : ""new cable customer id 566519401"",#012      ""eventValue"" : ""566519401""#012    },#012    {#012      ""statusType"" : ""EVENT_DETAIL"",#012      +{color:#00875a}*""eventCode"" : ""UXDU""#012*{color}+    }#012  ]#012};;;","02/Jul/25 9:11 AM;alka.kshirsagar2@vodafone.com;[~anton.ustimenko@vodafone.com] please check comment from Nina and provide your inputs;;;","02/Jul/25 12:29 PM;nina.pickl@vodafone.com;We did further analysis and find out that for some cancellation reasons the EventCodes values are missing in the VKD logs, Minerva didn't send the expected values to VKD.

However, I hope I receive feedback soon;;;","31/May/25 3:17 PM;revanasiddha.revanasiddha@vodafone.com;Hello Ari,

Yes. Mail is sent.;;;","02/Jun/25 4:42 PM;adam.schoska@vodafone.com;Hello colleagues,

First of all, apologies for my delayed response. Regarding the topic, I can only contribute to clarifying the business requirements, as my involvement was limited to the epic preparation. The requirement was clearly defined: this functionality is to be implemented exclusively for the retail channel, as telesales was entirely out of scope for this epic.

Kind regards,

Hi Natasa/Ran ,From omnius perspective the Firmenname is optional, So if agent doesn’t enter as it is optional. hence we don’t send it in submit order.

If the same field is mandatory at OGW because of which SKY ticket is created, then there is a gap between 2 application ,request to let us know what is expected from omnius ?

Sky Ticket: 

!image-2025-07-02-08-23-45-331.png!;;;","02/Jul/25 3:35 PM;tobias.pohlmann@vodafone.com;This problem seems to exist for longer and in different forms, for example this one from 2024: https://jira.sp.vodafone.com/browse/OSIP-1486 

[~joerg.trierweiler1@vodafone.com] investigated it and it seems like the problem is the following:
 * there are different places where a SOHO customer can enter a company name: in the customer details, the delivery options, the billing address
 * for a new customer order, the OSF frontend only forces the agent to enter the company name in the customer details; but if additional billing address or delivery options are given, the frontend makes it optional to enter the company name
 ** however, when such an order is send, OrderGateway creates a SkyForce ticket because the company name is missing => OSF frontend thinks the company name is optional, OGW seems to think it is mandatory
 * for existing customers the problem seems to be worse, because loading a SOHO customer pre-enters the company name in the customer details, but not for the other fields. 
 ** even if no deviating delivery address is chosen, OGW deems it mandatory and refuses the order

These orders do not arrive in VkdGateway, so the cable side never actually gets to see this. We do not understand how the validation in OrderGateway works, so we need TechM to investigate this further.

In ECC, the company name is also mandatory, but here the frontend supports that validation and does not allow you to actually check out and generate a wrong order.

I currently am not sure if there are additional validations down the line in the cable stack that would act up, too, when the company name is missing. We are in contact with colleagues about this.

But the problem at hand seems to stem from OrderGateway and cable has no way to investigate this much deeper.

We would need to know:
 * what validations for the company name existing OrderGateway
 * or more specifically for the case at hand: why are these order failing when placing an order for a new customer with additional delivery details?

[~ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com]  [~natasa.dimovic1@vodafone.com] 

Under Checkout delivery section for delivery method (different delivery address) inputbox “Firmenname“ is an optional input and it is designed since wave4. So working as designed

This is not a defect.

Also it was never requested to make this input field mandatory form UI.

If this input-field become mandatory in downgrade system (OGW/VKD) during fulfilment than this change must be done in Omnius as well. And I see this demand was missed to Omnius sol.

Either this could be handle as new demand or exiting demand OSF-14 can expand to cover SOHO usecase as well.;;;","16/Jul/25 4:17 PM;natasa.dimovic1@vodafone.com;Hi [~tobias.pohlmann@vodafone.com] it seems that VKD Gateway is not accepting this order and that's why it is failing with a Sky ticket.

OGW failure – > failed in initial queue

Sky ticket – > follow-up system refuses the order

If it would be mandatory field on OSF side, it would fail in earlier step already .

From our analysis its rejected from VKD Backend because this field is empty, so either VKD backend has to mark this field as optional (like its for OSF) or new request against OSF has to be raised.

Could you please check that again?

Thanks;;;","18/Jul/25 2:14 PM;tobias.pohlmann@vodafone.com;Hi [~natasa.dimovic1@vodafone.com]  [~vikash.saurav@vodafone.com] 

Do you think it would be possible to talk to a TechM colleague directly? I feel like this is going back and forth without any progress.

We are very certain that this is not a a VkdGateway behaviour, because in our logs, this order does not even arrive. Also, our systems don't have a validation for a mandatory company name, and the nomenclature COMPANY_NAME isn't used by us at all.

Also, the Sky-Tickets are not created by us, but by OSF. It may usually be a reaction of OSF to VkdGateway refusing an order – I cannot judge that, I cannot see OSF code. But then, it would be very nice if they could tell us what VkdGateway call supposedly refuses that order. Since they are writing the Sky tickets, they should be able to see that.

 

I believe it would be easiest if I could get in contact directly with them, so that this conversation is not mediated by you poor people. Do you have an idea who I could contact for this?;;;","18/Jul/25 4:11 PM;ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com;Hi Tobias, you can get in touch with Vikash or with Affan from Amdocs side

I think we had several calls already :(

[~atharva.paskanthi@vodafone.com]  please plan another call to check again, which process step expects this value for company name. Also with Amdocs please

 

So you mean to say, for cable its not a mandatory field to have the company name for SoHo customers in the different delivery adress and it should not be rejected by backends? 

 ;;;","18/Jul/25 8:07 PM;tobias.pohlmann@vodafone.com;Hi [~ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com] , 

yes, exactly. From the digging we did, we did not find any validation that checks for the company name being present. Also, the phrase ""COMPANY_NAME"" written as it is is something we do not use. I would hope that the colleagues from OSF could find in their code when the ""Required Input COMPANY_NAME missing"" error is constructed and written into the OGWERR-1408.

For us, it is completely intransparent how this error comes to be.

OSF and/or OrderGateway take these deliveryDetails entered in the frontend, and we could imagine that there is some validation in OrderGateway itself that causes the problem (but we can't know for sure). [~natasa.dimovic1@vodafone.com]  mentioned that a Sky-Ticket by OSF is usually created only when the cable systems refuse the order. I guess this would need to be the *orderNewCustomer* endpoint of VkdGateway, but we do not receive any calls on that endpoint in these cases. If this is in fact a reaction of OSF to some refusal by the cable systems, it would be very helpful to know what call OSF/OrderGateway is doing and what the response is from VkdGateway that causes OSF to write Sky-Ticket.

I hope communication is easier when we can directly talk to the colleagues, because the communication over this ticket seems to be very not ideal anymore.

 

(Regarding validations in our systems: the only validation that we have in regards of these customer addresses is that the deliveryDetails and billingInformation etc. – so all these extra customer details – must either all be for a private person or all be for a legal person (SOHO), but never mixed.  So, currently, we do not allow that a SOHO customer (customerPersonType = ""SOH"") enters a private address (deliveryPersonType=""KUN"").

But I am not aware of any cases where this caused problems yet in the communication with OSF – which might only be me being uninformed of course.);;;","21/Jul/25 12:23 PM;atharva.paskanthi@vodafone.com;Hello all, meeting is scheduled for tomorrow 2:30 CET;;;","21/Jul/25 5:59 PM;tobias.pohlmann@vodafone.com;Thank you very much!;;;","22/Jul/25 6:29 PM;atharva.paskanthi@vodafone.com;*OSF | Wave10.0 | Checkpoint | DM | OS-73030 | ACC1 | MoM and Action items (22nd July, 2025)*

Scenario to reproduce: ""At a KIP tariff change from consumer tariff with own hardware to a business tariff a Sky Ticket is created""
-> Customer has a consumer tariff and an own hardware (AON) in the inventory and changes to a business tariff but wants to keep own hardware 
-> IN OSF VKD BK can order Business product without ordering a new business device for 0€ . No new device is preselected in case customer has own one, that is compatible but it leads to a sky ticket as it seems customer does not have a hardware

 

One of the analysis results:

The problem might be how OSF or the product catalogue looks for existing devices. According to my analyses, the problem always occurs if no hardware is assigned to the outlet on the outlet on which the product is booked, e.g. IN1. ;;;","11/Mar/25 1:54 PM;gaurav.lanjewar1@vodafone.com;Sure [~ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com]  we will schedule a call to discuss on this issue with the mentioned participants.;;;","14/Mar/25 8:25 PM;ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com;Call planned 24th of March;;;","24/Mar/25 4:14 PM;gaurav.lanjewar1@vodafone.com;As discussed in today's call :
 * Tobias Thalacker, Vodafone has shared his observations &  states that TechM needs to investigate this. 
 * Bharath Krishnamurthy & Hari Shankar Malviya from TechM will check from their end and try to reproduce the issue.
 * We will wait for TechM's response. Then we will connect again if required.
 * Bharath Krishnamurthy will share the further updates.;;;","24/Mar/25 4:54 PM;ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com;Additional information from Portal bug Analysis:



The problem is how OSF or the product catalogue looks for existing devices. According to my analyses, the problem always occurs if no hardware is assigned to the outlet on the outlet on which the product is booked, e.g. IN1. 

Example 1: If a customer changes from a private tariff with device freedom to a business tariff, OSF does not book a device change here. However, the backend (ECC) expects a device change to OW1:B00 OHC:B00 or OH9:B00.
However, the agent does not receive any information that he has to select one of these options, nor does OSF prevent the transmission of the wrong order.

 

The question is:

1) should agent be forced in OSF Frontend to select a new device?

2) Should it be possible to keep the own device of the existing tariff?

And for both secnarios, is this controlled by Software or by product catalogue rules

Portal team stated its not on their side to fix it so we need to check on TechM side. ;;;","02/Apr/25 1:27 PM;natasa.dimovic1@vodafone.com;According to Cable team the behaviour should be like the following:
 * Customer with own hardware and consumer tariff changes to a business tariff

-- > Mandatory hardware change has to be triggered (at the moment this is not the case in OSF)

Hello Natasa/Sneha,
 
The warnings in the configurator and in extended shopping cart comes because of pcat rules only

Seems this issue is not relevant at all for production

[~anton.ustimenko@vodafone.com]  did you check the explanation of TechM and what is the concrete feedback on it?;;;","03/Jun/25 11:37 AM;tobias.thalacker@vodafone.com;[~anton.ustimenko@vodafone.com] 

The Vodafone Station ""VSA"" option is not permitted in a Business plan. Therefore, we continue to use the ""OW1"" option for Wi-Fi. It is important to ensure that an agent does not select the VSA option when switching the tier to a business product. The error seems to be with the PCAT, as this rule seems to be allowed there. The agent can deselect the preselected Homebox option from OSF and then automatically revert to the Vodafone Station option. In my view, this is wrong. The product catalog should automatically switch to the ""OW1"" Wi-Fi option.

The customer had a Vodafone station in the inventory and changed to a business tariff.

Inventory:

!image-2025-09-08-13-16-25-957.png!

When you changed to the business tariff, ""OHC:B00"" was booked automatically:  !image-2025-09-08-13-18-28-701.png!

For this use case we didn't have a bug. The bug is abut having OWN HARDWARE in the inventory ""AON"" and then changing to a business tariff. As far as I understood the Cable analysis, in that case also ""OHC:B00"" should be booked automatically like it is in ECC, but in OSF the own hardware is kept and then a Sky ticket is created. Could you please check that again on ACC1, as on ACC2 the ILS is blocked at the moment? Thanks

Hi Nasir ,

I have done some analysis about how and when we send the *Region* node on *Address* node ** of type {*}S{*}(Service Address).
 # Service address we send only when order contains Cable , DSL Packages, packages where serviceability check is mandatory to add into cart.

 # *Region* node will be sent under *Address* node ** of type {*}S{*}(Service Address) only if it is part of Validate Address response

In this above case we are doing cross sell by adding Mobile Package which does not need Service address and also order contains only mobile package so *Address* node ** of type {*}S{*}(Service Address) is not sent.

If its not clear we can have call with VF BA and discuss further.

Also this should not be P1 issue kindly discuss internally and can be reduced to P2;;;","30/Jan/25 6:17 PM;nasir.sayyad@vodafone.com;Hello

Hi Ari,
 
The Design to send region was in case of existing Mobile adding FN products. In this case the the XSell is on existing FN products to add new mobile package which does not have a pre-requisite of adding 'region' in the submit order. Hence this is a design gap, not a defect. This must be addressed via FT or a wave design.;;;","03/Feb/25 12:57 PM;ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com;[~bharath.krishnamurthy@vodafone.com]  its not xSell on existing FN products but xSELL on existing Cable product.

Hello Nasir,

As discussed with BA internally, this is an expected behavior as per design, when the order contains only mobile package then service address is not sent as a result region node also not sent also same is conveyed to Ari from previous comments.
To change the behavior it has to be discussed with VF BA and designed accordingly.;;;","21/Feb/25 4:25 PM;ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com;If there is Jira ticket first, then we do not raise Incident in production

Discussed with Dev on this and as per them it is not an issue or software bug as such. It is a process or design gap that need to clear with senior dev for which we will schedule a call with Senior dev and update further with their comments.

Issue has been discussed with bas and we come to solution, which is as below.

During the populate_additionalDb step we are thinking to update the catalog_tables.xml file as like we do during the resetModule upgrade process.

This should make the update similar and should solve our problem currently we are facing.

 

This change or fix cannot be fixed immediately as it needs quite development and more testing effort after the fix, as we don't have such env setup like ACC where we have separate Web & Script servers maintained. Also this issue should be part of the PROD aswell, may be its not observed on PROD or this feature never used in PROD.

Can you check and share this information if *populate_additionalDb.php* step is ever performed on PROD PLM process?;;;","23/Jan/25 5:22 PM;ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com;[~vikash.saurav@vodafone.com]  yes we are performing this step each night in the regular publish process;;;","27/Jan/25 11:26 AM;vikash.saurav@vodafone.com;Requested Tech M Production team to schedule call with VF OPS to check this on PROD;;;","29/Jan/25 12:03 PM;vikash.saurav@vodafone.com;SunilkumarCM added a comment
 
 
Hi All

I discussed this issue further with Waseem and discussed few possible solution.

Solution: we need to keep the *catalog_tables.xml* file on some central place and create symlink of it on all servers like Web servers, Script Servers, API servers, to avoid file differences between Web & Script servers, etc

Ideally it should be treated/managed to create symlink similar to the Cable artifact file we currently do after pcat import.

*Steps to follow to create symlink.*
 # Ideally we need to perform this Symlink create after the completion of PCAT import on Sandbox environment.

 # Then copy the file from Sandbox environment from the path \{{DOCROOT}}/app/etc/catalog_tables.xml and keep it on some central place

*Note: This copy file and create symlink should happen before we start the Publish activity.(Ideally after completion of PCAT import and before Publish start)*
 # Then start the publish process.

We need to discuss  so that this can be done on ACC and verified. KIndly schedule call for the same;;;","31/Jan/25 12:46 PM;atharva.paskanthi@vodafone.com;Call is scheduled today with TID Team;;;","31/Jan/25 4:58 PM;atharva.paskanthi@vodafone.com;*OSF | Wave9.2 | Checkpoint | DM | OS-65820 MoM and Action items (31st January, 2025)*

- Sunil had discussion with Waseem and suggested a workarounf
- We need to keep catalog_tables.xml file in central place , Need to handle it like cable Artifact file , keep it in shared path

TechM is working on a solution from code and infra side, but its not mandatory for production Go Live Wave 9.2 as issue is already present in production and temporarily solved. Unless no new package type will come up, it should not fail anymore.

Issue is caused by the solution for faster PCAT Publish (reduction of the publish downtime). Within this solution there is a design gap

reset modules are running on the application but its getting updated on Webservers only -> files on the script servers are not updated. There is a configuration in backend to connect to Webserver or Scriptserver and for security reasons we need to get the files from Scriptservers and cannot take it from Webservers

*Issue:*

This issue occurred due to mismatch in table on Sandbox and script server. The mismatch happened because “catalog_tables.xml” update on sandboxes is not reflected on other server.

 

{*}Solution{*}:

As part of this solution  we create a Symlink of  “catalog_tables.xml” and put in a central location so that  central location has always have updated   file of  “catalog_tables.xml”, whenever deployment will happen on other server it will pick this file “catalog_tables.xml”  from  central location  and not from pkg itself  so that other server will have  Web, Script & API etc will have updated file as well  so that when plm run from script server it will not  have mismatch of table issue  due to updated file there.

Based on the latest call below is the solution:

OSE deployment on Sandbox:
 # Check if catalog_tables.xml is present under the shared location (for example in ACC1: /opt/SP/websync/PRD_DATA/omnius/ACC1/catalogue/)
 # IF file is present, then create a symlink for the file in app/etc/catalog_tables.xml towards sharedpath/catalog_tables.xml for example in ACC1: /opt/SP/WEB_DATA/ACC1/omnius/osf-dintib-acc1/app/etc/catalog_tables.xml is symlinked to /opt/SP/websync/PRD_DATA/omnius/ACC1/catalogue/catalog_tables.xml file.
 # IF file is not present then COPY the catalog_tables.xml file from the tar package to the shared location (for example in ACC1 on the location /opt/SP/websync/PRD_DATA/omnius/ACC1/catalogue/catalog_tables.xml) and then create a symlink same as step 2.
 # *Either step 2 is taken or step 3, app/etc/catalog_tables.xml file should always be a symlink to the sharedlocation/catalog_tables.xml file at the end of SANDBOX deployment.*

OSE deployment on webser, api server, script server or any deployment other than SANDBOX deployment.
 # Create a symlink for the file app/etc/catalog_tables.xml to the file present in the sharedlocation/catalog_tables.xml. For example on ACC1 the file /opt/SP/WEB_DATA/ACC1/omnius/osf-telesales-int-acc1/app/etc/catalog_tables.xml is symlinked to /opt/SP/websync/PRD_DATA/omnius/ACC1/catalogue/catalog_tables.xml file

This will ensure that the changes done to catalog_tables.xml during PLM is also available in the webserver or script or api as the change is done to the file on the sharedlocation.

Hi Natasa ,

From the error message mentioned above it is clear that some of the backend connectivity between OGW and actual backend is timeout or may be between systems which comes after OGW facing some timeout issues. This has to be verified by the actual backend system where we received the above error.
 
 {{Title : Weblogic Bridge Message, Message = Failure of Web Server bridge:No backend server available for connection: timed out after 10 seconds or idempotent set to OFF or method not idempotent.}}
This is not error on OSE or the OIL system.;;;","11/Oct/24 4:29 PM;natasa.dimovic1@vodafone.com;Hi [~anton.ustimenko@vodafone.com], could you please ask a Cable developer to check this issue?

<Type>SOHO</Type> <CustomerSubType>PRIVATE</CustomerSubType> <CustomerPassword/> <PrivateCustomerInfo> <Salutation>R</Salutation> <SalutationC1Key/> <Title>Dr.</Title> <TitleC1Key/> <FirstName>Ajay</FirstName> <LastName>Order</LastName> <Nationality/> <IdentificationCardNumber/> <BirthDate/> <EmailAddress>ajay.bhavar@vodafone.com</EmailAddress> </PrivateCustomerInfo> <CompanyDetails> <Name>OSF Test</Name> <RegistrationNumber/> <RegistrationCity/> <RegistrationType/> <EmailAddress>ajay.bhavar@vodafone.com</EmailAddress> <PhoneList> <Phone> <CountryCode>0049</CountryCode> <AreaCode>0211</AreaCode> <PhoneNumber>124678</PhoneNumber> <Type>FIXED_PHONE</Type> </Phone> </PhoneList> <ContactPersonFirstName>Ajay</ContactPersonFirstName> <ContactPersonLastName>Order</ContactPersonLastName> </CompanyDetails> {code}
But when OGW is sending Activation Request (Json Request) towards Cable backend (VKD), It's not sending Salutation in input request.

Due to this issue, VKD system is adding FIRMA as a salutation for this request in backend but When customer is activated in backend and agent tries to perform in-life sales flow on same customer, Omnius asking to select value for salutation field.

As discussed - Omnius is having only Mr & Mrs values for Cable SOHO customer in checkout & VKD backend is having only FIRMA value for salutation in backend for Legal customer.

BEW Erfassen button should not available/disable.

 

*Actual Result:* BEW version is not updating in Backend and BEW Erfassen is enable, even after update the version.

i dont understand, which service is not working from OGW?

create document?

setPermission?

can you please explain?

also not sure what is this test data: 281507501
its not ogwOrderId and not Omnius order id;;;","01/Jul/24 4:35 PM;ran.farjun1@vodafone.com;Hi,

after the call today we can see that the flow is on standBy because no customer id is sent to ogw.
when customer id is being sent, OGW is triggering SetPermission request as expected;;;","01/Jul/24 7:04 PM;rohan.kumbhar@vodafone.com;

 !cable_minerva logs.png|thumbnail! 

Checked OSE/OGW calls where correct BEW update version with customer id is sent at UM backend where in Cable logs we see the request getting sent to UM via Minerva asking to update Version 4-- but somehow it seems UM is not updating Version 4 at their end - PFA SS for reference
For detail analysis check we need UM team support to check for this issue;;;","02/Jul/24 3:14 PM;rohan.kumbhar@vodafone.com; !screenshot-1.png|thumbnail! 

Tried new order for BEW with below details --same issue that from backend OSF is not getting the correct updated version as 4 in getcustomer details due to which the button is enabled for Unity media flow
customer id:953464201
documentID: 10875779;;;","03/Jul/24 12:53 AM;rohan.kumbhar@vodafone.com;here we see issue from Minerva adapter -- email sent to UM team to check on this issue 
;;;","04/Jul/24 6:28 PM;rohan.kumbhar@vodafone.com;As per the latest call on BEW topic.. there is a design GAP for the BEW flows which needs to be discussed by VF Design team.
as of now the problem here for this flow is that in the GetCustomerDetails Mode 3 call Omnius is always receiving BEWVersion as ""0"" irrespective of any other version is sent from OSF. So there is no checks nor validation of this BEW version at legacy backend and everytime Cable/UM will send Version 0 only.
So this is a design gap and currently this defect needs to be kept ON_HOLD until further clarification;;;","09/Jul/24 3:00 PM;ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com;[~rohan.kumbhar@vodafone.com]  who is taking this point now to discuss about unitymedia?
As its not only BEW only Retail which is not wroking, but also not for Telesales new customers in case its not IPCC triggered, and Retail new customers have never been tested.

So a general discussion is required?;;;","11/Jul/24 7:56 PM;ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com;[~rohan.kumbhar@vodafone.com]  based on the latest calls e have the following findings for Retail BEW and unitymedia in general

1) New customer, Retail, order + BEW -> Backend receives and stores BEW correctly

2) Existing customer, Retail, order + BEW -> Backend receives and stores BEW correctly

3) Existing customer, Retail, BEW only ->{color:#de350b} *Backend receives and stores BEW correctly? Please confirm this*
{color:#172b4d}What is wrong in all cases -> Frontend OSF is not able to retrieve the right BEW settings. So if BEW was updated in UNitymedia backend, Frontend is not reflecting this. It still looks like no BEW is set{color} ** 
{color:#172b4d}We will also compare the same for VKD, how Retrievecustomerinfo Mode 3 related to BEW permissions is looking like{color}{color};;;","12/Jul/24 3:20 PM;rohan.kumbhar@vodafone.com;As per latest observation it seems that Problem is happening only for the Unity Media customers when they chose BEW Options.
We tried 1 Cable New acquisition where BEW were correctly updated at backend and then we tried to fetch the same customer on OSF portal where correct Version status was reflected in GetCustomerDetails call and also BEW Button was disabled.

;;;","12/Jul/24 7:08 PM;ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com;[~rohan.kumbhar@vodafone.com]  the ticket itself is only for Unitymedia, so for VKD its not a problem and no ticket reported.

We still need to document here, if the Existing customer, Retail, BEW only for Unitymedia is reaching the backend as ticket says 

_*{color:#de350b}BEW version is not updating in Unity Backend{color}* and BEW Erfassen is enable even after update the version._

 

At the moment we assume, BEW version is getting updated in Unity backend, but we cannot retrieve the GetPermissions because its not giving back the correct version 
Unitymedia is handling permissions with Version 2, OGW expecting Version  4 and for retrieval of existing permissions we get Version 0.

Needs to be checked with responsible person from MinervaAdapter (VKD side);;;","17/Jul/24 2:34 PM;ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com;No progress yet as we did not identify the responsible person who can help with Minerva Adapter VKD ;;;","18/Jul/24 9:28 PM;ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com;I have enclosed the latest discussion.
As per latest analysis this problem is related to the way back from Unitymedia via Minerva Adapter VKD to OGW

{color:#de350b}*OK:*{color} OGW version 4 -> Minerva Adapter maps Version 4 from the VKD request into Version 2 for the request to UME/VFW -> UME/VFW is storing Version 2 correctly in Mood and showing right entries in RNS for the customer 

{color:#00875a}*Not OK*{color}: Now when we open the customer who has given BEW again in OSF, we expect that the stored BEW is taken and we are not asked to capture BEW again. Problem: For this get_permission Call we are receiving version 0 for the mentioned scenarios and we cannot map this version to our valid Version 4 (not OK)

{+}*Gap*{+}: We need a Mapping: UME/VFW is sending back Version 2 to Minerva Adapter-> Minerva Adapter maps Version 2 to Version 4 if getpermission request is coming from OGW

 

I have shared the feedback also with Jörg Trierweiler, Thomas Schneider, Andreas Baldermann and few more people to verify.
This is a general topic and not specifically related to BEW only Retail Epic
Waiting for feedback about possible next steps;;;","11/Aug/24 5:06 PM;ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com;I did not receive an answer yet from the experts how to handle this defect. However, I remind them again (Due to vacation might need some time until they reply).

Hi Natasa ,

But the response from DXL should have this pin towards OSE,if not how will we process the pin.;;;","06/Feb/24 2:50 PM;natasa.dimovic1@vodafone.com;Hi [~vikash.saurav@vodafone.com] could you please tell me to whom to assign the defect then? Thank you;;;","06/Feb/24 3:08 PM;vikash.saurav@vodafone.com;HI [~natasa.dimovic1@vodafone.com]  Please assign to DXL team. ;;;","06/Feb/24 3:15 PM;natasa.dimovic1@vodafone.com;Hi [~rohan.kumbhar@vodafone.com] could you please check this issue with the DXL team? Thank you;;;","07/Feb/24 4:40 PM;natasa.dimovic1@vodafone.com;Hi [~vikash.saurav@vodafone.com] the customer 934800577 is a VKD KUD customer, but on a Unity Media address. This seems to be the issue

This is the answer from Raniero:

You need to check with OSF, this is what OSF is sending:
and OSF is sending a request for an UM customer (BW = Baden Württenberg).

This is a urn for a VKD customer:

!image-2024-02-07-12-08-44-486.png!

This is a urn for a UM customer:

!image-2024-02-07-12-09-00-539.png!

In SoapUI you are sending a request for a VKD customer, OSF sends a request for an UM customer.

Could you please check that again? Thanks;;;","07/Feb/24 5:33 PM;vikash.saurav@vodafone.com;Divya Kumbla added a comment -
 
 
Hi [~natasa.dimovic1@vodafone.com]  ,Again the decision of whether the customer is VKD or UM is based on AccountCategory in getCustomerResult for index search

and Region in retrieveCustomerInfo mode1 for Legacysearch.

For reference

!image-2024-02-07-17-32-45-292.png!

So we need to check what is coming for this customer for which you need to share the search response and mode1 response logs.;;;","07/Feb/24 6:06 PM;natasa.dimovic1@vodafone.com;Hi [~vikash.saurav@vodafone.com] please find attached the logs;;;","08/Feb/24 1:12 PM;vikash.saurav@vodafone.com;Divya Kumbla added a comment -
 
Hi [~natasa.dimovic1@vodafone.com] 

As said earlier the region from mode1 decides if its VKD or UM, and as per attached logs we receive region as UME-KBW hence OSE considers it as UM customer.

The issue is that A KUD only customer on a Unity address is handled like a Unity customer but it is a VKD customer. Is this WAD or a bug? Thanks;;;","08/Feb/24 3:43 PM;ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com;[~natasa.dimovic1@vodafone.com]  let me check with Unitymedia team, will take some time 
This scenario never worked in the past, when testing SPIN in the release itself right? I think we did not have tried such a customer.;;;","08/Feb/24 4:04 PM;natasa.dimovic1@vodafone.com;Hi [~ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com] I never tried a VKD KUD customer on a Unity Media address. It is not easy to find such a customer and this customer was found only by chance. Thank you ;;;","13/Feb/24 2:18 PM;ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com;currently checking initial requirements, what was requested in user stories for SPIN, will take some more time. I will keep it on hold for now ;;;","19/Feb/24 8:26 PM;ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com;received some feedback about handling for UM/ VKD in general, need to check and need some days;;;","21/Feb/24 5:57 PM;ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com;still checking with solution design team - As per requirement for index customer search we should check the value AccountCategory -> and for VKD customer it should receive the value KD.

Will share some more information in some time;;;","23/Feb/24 7:30 PM;ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com;Discussed today with Andreas Baldermann - he is going to document the expected behavior for customer search and display VKD/UM now to further work on this ticket.

 * Values like ""AccountCategory"" in Omnius are derived from OGW: Here:- _AccountCategory_ in getCustomerResult for index search and _Region_ in retrieveCustomerInfo mode1 for LegacySearch.
 * As the ADDRESS REGION is in UM Area - it is treated as UM customer, even though he belongs to the VKD Stack

h4. _Possible SD option to be validated/proven:_ 
 * Derive customer stack from GlobalID prefix (""legacy stack"")  instead of address region
 * IF improvements required as this is only known by OGW (Omnius can only see LK_ from linked customers) - e.g. introducing new attribute to indicate customers product stack:
 * CustomerSearch()
 * getCustomerDetails()
 * [@Mitra, Gaurab, External Vendor|mailto:gaurab.mitra@amdocs.com]: We should investigate if further interfaces have to be considered (To be discussed on next CR meeting)

[@Kshitij.Srivastava@comviva.com|mailto:kshitij.srivastava@comviva.com]: To check UseCases in Omnius to be considered for an improvement

Further benefit: Omnius Performance increase If product stack information is directly provided by OGW 

 

So team is working on possible solution but will take some time ;;;","17/May/24 11:42 AM;ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com;Asked Andreas Baldermann and TEchM for update of status;;;","17/May/24 12:15 PM;ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com;Update: We are still in analysis with TechM and Amdocs.

This seems to be generic error as the system cannot differentiate between VKD and Unity anymore on this step

for the first request i can see that:

<TargetSystem>KD</TargetSystem>

so seems like VKD customer.
for the second request:

<LineOfBusiness>Cable</LineOfBusiness>
<TargetSystem></TargetSystem>

TargetSystem is empty, if its UM it should be like so:
<TargetSystem>UM</TargetSystem>

else we will sent is as VKD customer;;;","22/Jan/24 8:57 PM;ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com;Hi [~vikash.saurav@vodafone.com]  as per information from Ran something is missing in the setpermission request, so not sure if something is wrong on Ominus/OSE Side? can you please check and share your input? ;;;","24/Jan/24 11:55 AM;vikash.saurav@vodafone.com;SunilkumarCM added a comment - 
 
Hi [~ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com]  ,

I don't see the steps to reproduce and if its for existing customer we need mode logs and serviceability logs between OSE<->OIL & OIL<->OGW.

Thanks

[~alka.kshirsagar2@vodafone.com] fyi;;;","24/Jan/24 3:56 PM;ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com;[~vikash.saurav@vodafone.com]  I was not creating any order, I am just scanning portal UI tool from time to time to find unidentified issues. And within this quality check I have found tickets with this error message. 

 

After some analysis I have identified, that it seems to be this scenario:

-> Search existing unitymedia customer and perform Move to VKD adress 

 

this is example Order ID from ACC1 - it failed with 2 sky tickets

One ticket because of invalid VPKN (issue is solved, please ignore that) and second sky ticket was for setpermission.


Unfortunately Sky ticket were cleared in between so I am not able to find my two tickets anymore..... But hopefully you can reproduce on your environment for a Move from Unity to VKD.

Seems like in this case the existing customer ID from unity is taken over, instead of recognizing that customer will get a new customer ID from VKD for Move scenario

 

Order ID 782545, Customer ID 1009755201 (initial customer before Move) 

!image-2024-01-24-11-21-17-927.png!

 

Same seems to happen when moving from Unity Cable to DSL product. 

So please check flow Unity Cable to VKD Cable Move, and Unity Cable to DSL Move

 ;;;","25/Jan/24 5:24 PM;ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com;We have placed another order yesterday.

*Move from Unity Cable to VKD Cable* with permission selection in checkout.
Omnius Order ID 783467

 

In SetPermission Call I see that its called for Cable - {*}UN{*}, but the target customer is VKD Customer after Move. 



So I would expect in the setpermission call that system is calling VKD with new VKD customer ID, right? It does not make sense to store a permission in unitymedia backend when the customer is going to be inactive there, and will be active only in VKD in the future with new customer ID

Hi [~ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com]  ,

Further based on investigation above is the expected behavior. Which means for the existing customer we are getting the region value from Install Base and if region value which is from the IB or from the serviceability(in ACQ) is not matching with the below table data which is agreed during the design, then OSE send empty <CustomerList><CustomerDetails>{*}<TargetSystem>{*}.

If for any new region value VF expects to send *TargetSystem* value then it has to be added to OSE via SRT
