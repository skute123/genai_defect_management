-----------------

TechM: 

The purpose of the CR is to have same delivery details(delivery address + delivery date) if we have multiple Cable packages in the order.

System will show the UI of capture delivery method details only for first package and for the rest of the cable packages in the order it will show the package name only.

There are no changes on wish date, it will remain as is

-------------

Earlier we had this CR but it got removed from Software and probably therefore we do not see any other values in the dropdown for the wish date for UM

where is OGW is getting the EAI000987 error from?
i didnt saw any set order status being sent to OGW.
is the error coming from a different place?

i do see some error from vfde_kias_submitorder_ChangeTariff_flow :

is this what you mean?

if we have this error, EAI000039, according to ogw_error_handler, we need to ignore it and not create sky ticket.

OGW dosent know how the LTE backend is working or which values it need to validate.
what Affan had mention is that we are sending the values that Omnius is sending to OGW.
if areaCode or PhoneNumber is missing from the OGW request its because Omnius didnt send it to OGW.
you need to check with Marko which tag is missing from the request and then check with Omnius why they are not sending it to OGW;;;","24/Dec/24 12:07 PM;gaurav.lanjewar1@vodafone.com;[~marco.abraham01@vodafone.com]  will be back on 8th Jan then only we can check with him.

Hi all,

 

concerning the logic of providing the parameter in the service availability call for existing customers:
 # If a TASI exist for the customer this one has to be provided (which works currently)
 # If no TASI is found (which is the case for all LTE customers) the existing phone number has to be send -> to be provided as phonenumber

           2.1 And in addition the ONKZ value -> to be provided as areaCode

 

The part 2.1 seems to be missing

 

During the first waves we had the discussion how the parameters should be filled

 

Please check if the parameter is already missing in Omnius or only on OGW side.

In GetProductAvailability request  areaCode with phonenumber is present.;;;","09/Jan/25 12:07 PM;ran.farjun1@vodafone.com;Hi [~vikash.saurav@vodafone.com] ,

we are looking for AreaCode or PhoneNumber from the request, how  ExistingCustomerTN is related?;;;","09/Jan/25 1:48 PM;ran.farjun1@vodafone.com;Hi Vikash,

i think i can see the issue.

wehn you are sending: <ExistingCustomerTN>021154476783</ExistingCustomerTN>

OGW will take this as phone number without the 0.

but Marko also mention: If no TASI we need phone number and area code.

currently OGW only send phone number becasue area code is missing from the request.

this is the request:

Hi [~ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com] [~natasa.dimovic1@vodafone.com] 

Based on further analysis it is identified that issue is also part of production build , not part of any recent delivery towards ACC and there is no clue that it was working before as well.

And there is no change on price calculations recently and so it takes time to identify the root cause, our primary suspect is that it can be PCAT issue.

Note: The problematic product is added by sales rule and if we add the product manually the price show correctly.;;;","18/Dec/24 1:53 PM;ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com;If you need any PCAT support for analysis just reach to them out directly and do a session to investigate;;;","20/Dec/24 12:52 PM;vikash.saurav@vodafone.com;As discussed with [~sandeepkumar.pradhan@vodafone.com] we will deliver in next available slot to Production on January based the delivery defect count as agreed VF.  ;;;","07/Jan/25 6:20 PM;atharva.paskanthi@vodafone.com;Hello Vikash Saurav, Vodafone (External), could you please check and update ETA for this ticket;;;","08/Jan/25 1:12 PM;vikash.saurav@vodafone.com;will deliver on 29.01 or post 9.1.2 minor release .what ever is earlier;;;","08/Jan/25 2:34 PM;ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com;on 29th of January there is no delivery to ACC1- production fixes are in freeze as on 5th of February ACC3 release is going live;;;","10/Jan/25 3:44 PM;vikash.saurav@vodafone.com;Sandeep Pradhan added a comment -

Hi All,

Discussed with Dev on this and as per them it is not an issue or software bug as such. It is a process or design gap that need to clear with senior dev for which we will schedule a call with Senior dev and update further with their comments.

Issue has been discussed with bas and we come to solution, which is as below.

During the populate_additionalDb step we are thinking to update the catalog_tables.xml file as like we do during the resetModule upgrade process.

This should make the update similar and should solve our problem currently we are facing.

 

This change or fix cannot be fixed immediately as it needs quite development and more testing effort after the fix, as we don't have such env setup like ACC where we have separate Web & Script servers maintained. Also this issue should be part of the PROD aswell, may be its not observed on PROD or this feature never used in PROD.

Can you check and share this information if *populate_additionalDb.php* step is ever performed on PROD PLM process?;;;","23/Jan/25 5:22 PM;ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com;[~vikash.saurav@vodafone.com]  yes we are performing this step each night in the regular publish process;;;","27/Jan/25 11:26 AM;vikash.saurav@vodafone.com;Requested Tech M Production team to schedule call with VF OPS to check this on PROD;;;","29/Jan/25 12:03 PM;vikash.saurav@vodafone.com;SunilkumarCM added a comment
 
 
Hi All

I discussed this issue further with Waseem and discussed few possible solution.

Solution: we need to keep the *catalog_tables.xml* file on some central place and create symlink of it on all servers like Web servers, Script Servers, API servers, to avoid file differences between Web & Script servers, etc

Ideally it should be treated/managed to create symlink similar to the Cable artifact file we currently do after pcat import.

*Steps to follow to create symlink.*
 # Ideally we need to perform this Symlink create after the completion of PCAT import on Sandbox environment.

 # Then copy the file from Sandbox environment from the path \{{DOCROOT}}/app/etc/catalog_tables.xml and keep it on some central place

*Note: This copy file and create symlink should happen before we start the Publish activity.(Ideally after completion of PCAT import and before Publish start)*
 # Then start the publish process.

We need to discuss  so that this can be done on ACC and verified. KIndly schedule call for the same;;;","31/Jan/25 12:46 PM;atharva.paskanthi@vodafone.com;Call is scheduled today with TID Team;;;","31/Jan/25 4:58 PM;atharva.paskanthi@vodafone.com;*OSF | Wave9.2 | Checkpoint | DM | OS-65820 MoM and Action items (31st January, 2025)*

TechM is working on a solution from code and infra side, but its not mandatory for production Go Live Wave 9.2 as issue is already present in production and temporarily solved. Unless no new package type will come up, it should not fail anymore.

Issue is caused by the solution for faster PCAT Publish (reduction of the publish downtime). Within this solution there is a design gap

reset modules are running on the application but its getting updated on Webservers only -> files on the script servers are not updated. There is a configuration in backend to connect to Webserver or Scriptserver and for security reasons we need to get the files from Scriptservers and cannot take it from Webservers

*Issue:*

This issue occurred due to mismatch in table on Sandbox and script server. The mismatch happened because “catalog_tables.xml” update on sandboxes is not reflected on other server.

 

{*}Solution{*}:

As part of this solution  we create a Symlink of  “catalog_tables.xml” and put in a central location so that  central location has always have updated   file of  “catalog_tables.xml”, whenever deployment will happen on other server it will pick this file “catalog_tables.xml”  from  central location  and not from pkg itself  so that other server will have  Web, Script & API etc will have updated file as well  so that when plm run from script server it will not  have mismatch of table issue  due to updated file there.

Based on the latest call below is the solution:

OSE deployment on Sandbox:
 # Check if catalog_tables.xml is present under the shared location (for example in ACC1: /opt/SP/websync/PRD_DATA/omnius/ACC1/catalogue/)
 # IF file is present, then create a symlink for the file in app/etc/catalog_tables.xml towards sharedpath/catalog_tables.xml for example in ACC1: /opt/SP/WEB_DATA/ACC1/omnius/osf-dintib-acc1/app/etc/catalog_tables.xml is symlinked to /opt/SP/websync/PRD_DATA/omnius/ACC1/catalogue/catalog_tables.xml file.
 # IF file is not present then COPY the catalog_tables.xml file from the tar package to the shared location (for example in ACC1 on the location /opt/SP/websync/PRD_DATA/omnius/ACC1/catalogue/catalog_tables.xml) and then create a symlink same as step 2.
 # *Either step 2 is taken or step 3, app/etc/catalog_tables.xml file should always be a symlink to the sharedlocation/catalog_tables.xml file at the end of SANDBOX deployment.*

OSE deployment on webser, api server, script server or any deployment other than SANDBOX deployment.
 # Create a symlink for the file app/etc/catalog_tables.xml to the file present in the sharedlocation/catalog_tables.xml. For example on ACC1 the file /opt/SP/WEB_DATA/ACC1/omnius/osf-telesales-int-acc1/app/etc/catalog_tables.xml is symlinked to /opt/SP/websync/PRD_DATA/omnius/ACC1/catalogue/catalog_tables.xml file

This will ensure that the changes done to catalog_tables.xml during PLM is also available in the webserver or script or api as the change is done to the file on the sharedlocation.

Well, Frederik stated:
 * There was no change on Cable side
 * There was no change on bundle side

I trust him concerning first point and I have same opinion on the second one.
I would suggest to ask the TechM guys for a more detailed logging of the bundle rule to check why it's working on ACC2 but not on ACC1.
[~natasa.dimovic1@vodafone.com] , [~anja.moellenbeck@vodafone.com]  could you please take care that TechM taking a look?

 ;;;","03/Dec/24 9:19 PM;natasa.dimovic1@vodafone.com;Hi [~vikash.saurav@vodafone.com], please check the previous comment. Thanks;;;","04/Dec/24 2:09 AM;frederik.finckh@vodafone.com;I am pretty sure the problem on acc1 vs acc2 is neither a cable nor a mobile pcat issue. See [my last comment on the PSTBUG ticket|https://de.jira.agile.vodafone.com/browse/PSTBUG-2798?focusedId=1164001&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels%3Acomment-tabpanel#comment-1164001].
BTW as there were hints about a broken cable rules artifact, I can not help but remark that the most likely reason why the correct product shows up in the contract summary is because the cable rules automatically correct the messed up selection in this case once they are actually executed.;;;","04/Dec/24 3:41 PM;anton.ustimenko@vodafone.com;Last comment from Frederick in PSTBUG:

When investigating this bug it only occured on the ACC1 and not the ACC2.
The cable posting rules are out of the question, as they are not even executed when clicking the gigakombi button.

We also checked the relevant input files on cable and mobile pcat side (Bundles.xml).
Diffing the involved cable products easily showed no significant changes.
The relevant bundle rule in this case is GK1a gigakombi bundle rule that has not changed in a very long time.
In particular I specifically checked exactly the imported version of the Bundles.xml.
This is why I wrote that this is an OSF issue.

Diving into OSFs backend shows that the problem is indeed not the input, but rather how it was processed and came out on the other side.

Bug was not reproducible on ACC2

but occured on ACC1
!image-2024-12-03-20-40-43-675.png!

Probably OSF is best adviced to check the colons in their backend.;;;","04/Dec/24 3:44 PM;anja.moellenbeck@vodafone.com;[~vikash.saurav@vodafone.com] please find the relevant infos from PSTBUG on Antons comment below;;;","04/Dec/24 5:50 PM;anton.ustimenko@vodafone.com;[~vikash.saurav@vodafone.com] , the problem is also reproducible via MHV frontend as well which is using same OSF Bundle Eligibility Service.

Hello [~natasa.dimovic1@vodafone.com] [~anton.ustimenko@vodafone.com]  this is rule issue

!image-2024-12-05-13-43-59-237.png!

This product doesn’t exist in product manager.

!image-2024-12-05-13-44-38-712.png!

That is causing the issue

Actually : is missing in rules action if we see screenshot
if I search with : in product manager I can see the product

On ACC1 the colon is missing between the product code and the promotion code for all GigaKombi eligible Phone Flats (also in Condition):

On ACC2 the colon is there for all GigaKombi eligible Phone Flats:

We checked the PCAT Bundle Rules and there the colon is entered. There was no change.

Hello [~natasa.dimovic1@vodafone.com] I have imported the acc1 pcat that you shared with Prod branch issue still exists

Hi [~vikash.saurav@vodafone.com] could you figure out why the colon is missing in BO? Thanks;;;","09/Dec/24 2:59 PM;frederik.finckh@vodafone.com;Hi [~natasa.dimovic1@vodafone.com] I am absolutely certain the issue of missing colons in the OSF backend is not caused by the cable pcat.
Therefore, I think that there is no need to compare the cable versions here.

I do suspect that the issue is the different version of OSF on acc1 vs acc2 as the Bundles.xml input looks fine.

The bundle rules are neither defined, nor processed from cable side.;;;","09/Dec/24 3:04 PM;natasa.dimovic1@vodafone.com;Thank you, [~frederik.finckh@vodafone.com]

if checkout (delivery section) and not shown and no data captured for Delivery then there is no delivery data send in SubmitOrder.

To generate Mode 4 logs, the assigned configuration must include a combination of MTAN and NO FLEX. In our current test, we used only SPIN_CAB and 20FX, so Mode 4 logs were not generated. If you need Mode 4 logs, I will test with the MTAN combination and provide an update.

Hi [Krishnkumar Satpute, Vodafone|https://jira.sp.vodafone.com/secure/ViewProfile.jspa?name=krishnkumar.satpute%40vodafone.com] , We can see as per mode 4 there is only one account and that is mobile (KIAS).

So in this case SPIN_CAB is not eligible thats why we are able to see only 2OFX

Note:- in Mode 2 i can see both KIAS and KD , so please check and reject this ticket as it is customer data issue;;;","22/Oct/24 4:43 PM;krishnkumar.satpute@vodafone.com;Hello Balaji,

[~marco.abraham01@vodafone.com] has already analyzed the bug:

 
 * at ILS no information about SecureNet is provided to the Backend (Also at a cancellation of SecureNet nothing os provided to the Backend)

 * missing refComponentId in Component for SecureNet in RetrieveCustomerInfo - Mode2 logs

For *other components* there is a refComponentId, e. g.:  

!image-2024-10-15-11-00-06-711.png!

DB Size
Observed that ITROMDB is significantly larger than PRROMDB. Despite the size difference,there is no noticeable impact on performance.

DB Configuration
Compared the configurations, both databases have identical configurations, including software versions and patches.

SGA (System Global Area) 
Compared SGA components such as shared pool, buffer cache, and redo log buffer, including their sizes and configurations. All components are  same in both database.

Gather Stats Status for Specific Tables
Checked statistics gathering status for tables OM_REPORTING_IN, OM_REQUEST,EA_REQUEST,OM_REQUEST,OM_ORDER,OMS_RENDERRESULT,OM_REPORTING_OUT and OM_ORDER. Include details on when stats were last gathered and their current status. All table stats are up to date and no table found in stale_stats status

Hi Natasa ,

From the error message mentioned above it is clear that some of the backend connectivity between OGW and actual backend is timeout or may be between systems which comes after OGW facing some timeout issues. This has to be verified by the actual backend system where we received the above error.
 
 {{Title : Weblogic Bridge Message, Message = Failure of Web Server bridge:No backend server available for connection: timed out after 10 seconds or idempotent set to OFF or method not idempotent.}}
This is not error on OSE or the OIL system.;;;","11/Oct/24 4:29 PM;natasa.dimovic1@vodafone.com;Hi [~anton.ustimenko@vodafone.com], could you please ask a Cable developer to check this issue? Thank you;;;","11/Oct/24 4:46 PM;anton.ustimenko@vodafone.com;[~natasa.dimovic1@vodafone.com] , [~bharath.krishnamurthy@vodafone.com] is this error reproducable? the error message with weblogic pointed out that some of the servers was down. Maybe test has been executed to the ""bad"" time (downtime or on the edge to downtime)?;;;","14/Oct/24 11:50 AM;natasa.dimovic1@vodafone.com;Hi [~anton.ustimenko@vodafone.com] yes, the issue is still reproducible:

Here would be good to see the submitOrder request/response from log to find out which service call is went into this error.

Thank you;;;","16/Oct/24 1:13 PM;bharath.krishnamurthy@vodafone.com;[~natasa.dimovic1@vodafone.com]

Well this issue needs to investigate in OGW sol. what is the reason there is SKY ticket created in OGW sol.

The strange thing is/ the question that shouild be answered by the Acctesting team/ Amdocs:   Why is it working okay in production and not okay in the acctest?

we have discussed this defect together with Gaurab from Amdocs in one of the sessions, last week, in which we analysed E2E the expected behaviour and discussed some defects.

Also Waldemar and Michael Heller were involved.

 

1. What I miss in this error description is the EXACT activities, that the agent/tester has done.

my assumption is:  the agent has selected the unsharp sim swap (which is a possibility in Retail, that will disappear with the esim Push Epic, but is still available if the permission for insert sim_serial_number is set (I think)

so..  question:  did indeed the tester select the UNSHARP SIMSWAP?

 

Because:

IF Agent selects UNSHARP SIMSWAP, 

THEN SubmitOrder.SIMCARD = E (as it always was)

and... OGW is triggered to send the emails when SIMCARD =E

(so.. this is not correct)

 

AS AGREED WITH GAURAB :

Amdocs will change/improve the software:

OGW will not only check for SIMCARD = E,  but will also check whether the NEW_SIM_SERIAL_NUMBER is not populated.

only then the emails will be sent;;;","30/Dec/24 3:46 PM;ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com;[~akash.ubbu@vodafone.com]  [~ajay.bhavar@vodafone.com]  [~elena.fueger@vodafone.com]  can you comment on the question from Rob?

-> did indeed the tester select the UNSHARP SIMSWAP?

 

(set to ""in progress"" again - as per comment amdocs is working on a fix);;;","30/Dec/24 5:25 PM;ajay.yashwantbhavar@vodafone.com;-> did indeed the tester select the UNSHARP SIMSWAP?

Hello [~robert.goebbels@vodafone.com] In both cases, Email is getting triggered, As the parameter SIMSWAP reason is always handed over to OGW with the value VR (Unsharp) even if the agent has selected Sharp (VS) in front end.

Please find below screenshot from submit order request.

Summary: 
 * works as (wrongly) designed
 * Amdocs will fix this without the need of a Change Request
 ** OGW will not only check:  is SIMTYPE E, in order to trigger the emails, BUT also check if the SIMNumber is empty

 

Details:

RETAIL channel; blocking permissions set:
 * agent must therefore insert SIM number (instead of SIMTYPE) AND
 * agent has possiblity to select Sharp vs unsharp simswap 

Omnius sends in submit Order
 * SIMYPE E, because agent has selected unsharp SIMSWAP (not clear to me, but it looks like Omnius also sends SIMTYPE E, if the agent selected sharp SIMSWAP, if I understand the comments right). 
 * SIMSERIAL number (because Agent has inserted a (physical) SIMnumber 

OGW triggers 5910 and/or 5930 email although the agent has inserted a (physical)  sim number

 

Solution: Even if Omnius sends SIMTYPE E,  OGW must also check, if a SIMNumber is provided  in submitOrder.  if the simnumber is empty, only then trigger the emails 

-->  as aligned with Gaurab some weeks ago

can you please attached them here;;;","28/Sep/24 5:26 PM;gagan.patkar@vodafone.com;Hi [~ran.farjun1@vodafone.com] 
We are performing GUI testing for ACC3, so basically all retrieve customers are triggering OGW services in backend.
As we had agreed long ago, I had attached the respected test data (customer) and login Id (correlation id) along with the Kibana monitoring service logs for your reference.
I believe you can easily find the OGW services which are taking time once you with go through the logs attached. 
For you reference I have also sent you Catalina logs through H2H file transfer.;;;","30/Sep/24 1:02 PM;ran.farjun1@vodafone.com;In this defect , it's not specified from OGW POV where is the delay exactly .
e.g we have seen that correlation id being used for 3 OGW services
1) Legacysearch 
2) GetCustomerDetails
3) GetProductAvailability
To investigate anything further we will exact OGW service details which is causing delay.
Also we tried to analyse <CorrelationID>1clpme6urq144am5p9pl83q0ki</CorrelationID> where VFDEGetCustomerDetails  is getting called twice .

 

Please share valid data to investigate further with more detailed details of OGW service;;;","30/Sep/24 1:19 PM;gagan.patkar@vodafone.com;!screenshot-1.png|thumbnail!
I hope this info will be helpful for you.

Please find the attached image of a table that describing the Service calls for OSE, OIL and OGW,



{color:#ff8b00}Also Please provide the list of services invoked for OGW end during customer retrieve transaction so we could be on same page.{color}

Apart from this if the degradation is not from the OGW end or from Environment itself Please provide a statement that the degradation is not due to OGW so I can assign the ticket to TechM for further analysis.

I have provided all required info for your debugging and defect analysis, if you required, we can setup a call including TechM also for further analysis.;;;","14/Oct/24 3:24 PM;ran.farjun1@vodafone.com;Hi Gagan,

Hello Vishal,

 

I we check the logs where are seeing options correclty
we can see we are getting TECNOKIP is selectable and visible true

if we check acc logs we are getting visible false

This need to be checked with PCAT team

At these adresses it is correct that the customer/agent does not get to select any technician options for a pure KIP order.
This behaviour was recently changed with a requirement on Portal Solution side.

As such I believe the ticket can be closed.;;;","16/Sep/24 3:13 PM;natasa.dimovic1@vodafone.com;Hi [~simon.auch@vodafone.com] could you please tell us with which requirement this was changed?

So the expected result should be like this?

 * only KIP Selfinstall = no – > Sehbereitschaft option available, only 1 option  

           only KIP Selfinstall = yes - no – > Sehbereitschaft option will be available

Due to this issue, VKD system is adding FIRMA as a salutation for this request in backend but When customer is activated in backend and agent tries to perform in-life sales flow on same customer, Omnius asking to select value for salutation field.

As discussed - Omnius is having only Mr & Mrs values for Cable SOHO customer in checkout & VKD backend is having only FIRMA value for salutation in backend for Legal customer.

Hi, Ariadne,

{*}{color:#de350b}yes, I can confirm that in any case where we book KIP + TV (no matter if Broadvision or not, no matter which order we book it in), no technician section should be shown{color}{*}. 

The reason why this fails is as I tried to point out in my comment below. It really is pretty confusing, I apologize for that. I had a call with Natasa where I explained the problem, because it really is a bit hard to grasp.

So again in case of Broadvision what happens is:
 - [In the KIP package] KIP is booked, TV Connect is added because of Broadvision ---> OSF understands that no section for KIP should be shown because KIP + TV is booked and remembers that

 - [In the TV package] TV Digital is booked ---> OSF understands that no section for TV should be shown because KIP+TV is booked

==> no KIP or TV technician section is shown

In case of Not-Broadvision:
 - [In the KIP package] Only KIP is booked, but not TV yet ----> OSF supposes that a technician section should be shown for KIP (because only KIP is booked) and remembers that
 - [In the TV package] TV Digital + TV Connect is booked ----> OSF understands that no section for TV should be shown because KIP+TV is booked, but doesn't update the reasoning for KIP

==> technician section is shown for KIP, but not for TV;;;","10/Jul/24 8:34 PM;tobias.pohlmann@vodafone.com;Hi guys,

so, yesterday, we were asked by [~timo.russo@vodafone.com] to change the behaviour for KIP-only bookings, too; [[PSTBUG-2380] OSF_One Sehberetischaft option is available on NE3, NE4 VVO and MNV addresses in OSF while booking KIP only for new customers - DE Jira (vodafone.com).|https://de.jira.agile.vodafone.com/browse/PSTBUG-2380]

With this change (product setup version V2390_2024_07_00_086), this symptom here will not occur anymore, so I guess we could close this ticket. I apologize for the confusion.

But the underlying bug – OSF doesn't update the technician options it will display for KIP when it is currently in the TV package – still needs to be fixed as it is also the cause for https://jira.sp.vodafone.com/browse/OS-58440 .;;;","15/Jul/24 12:36 PM;ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com;[~tobias.pohlmann@vodafone.com]  so means we should keep ticket OS-58435 on hold until it got fixed by PSTBUG-2380 and assign it to you instead of TechM?;;;","15/Jul/24 1:25 PM;tobias.pohlmann@vodafone.com;Yes, we can do that.

This issue is fixed in product_setup V2390_2024_07_00_086 for *self-install* addresses. But not yet for *not-self-install* addresses. Since this is a bit more involved we will do this with a different requirement that  [~timo.russo@vodafone.com] is currently writing but which is not quite here yet. 
So, this might come in PI-31 (not the upcoming one, but the one after).

I'd suggest to keep this open and assigned to me for now.;;;","18/Jul/24 2:22 PM;ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com;Thanks Tobias, please inform us when we can retest for not-Self-Install adress;;;","08/Aug/24 12:52 PM;natasa.dimovic1@vodafone.com;Hi [~tobias.pohlmann@vodafone.com] any update?

It is a candidate for the upcoming PI 24-31, which will start in the second half of September.

 Ah yes, you are correct.
We didn't do anything yet, but since OSF in the mean time fixed this bug:
OS-58440 OSF | Wave 9.0 | CR716 Futurize | Regression | when booking 1st TV and then KIP (not Broadvision) the technician option for TV is displayed in the Access Details - Vodafone Global Jira

this here is also solved. 

So, we can close this now. Thanks for bringing my attention back to this.

Sorry, I am uncertain: may I just close this, or does anyone with more authority need to do that?

Because, I just re-checked that bug (OS-58440) which was re-tested and marked as solved according to the comments, but when testing it now on ACC1 I still have the old problem, too. So, if I first book TV and then KIP and then go to checkout, then the technician option for TV is displayed.

Not sure if it came back somehow (or I am just confused right now), but I think once OS-58440 is fixed, OS-58435 should be fixed as well. And for me it looks like, both bugs are still present on ACC1.;;;","19/Oct/24 1:30 PM;natasa.dimovic1@vodafone.com;[~tobias.pohlmann@vodafone.com] you were right.

We will remove this feature that is incorrectly calculated by OSF in the scope of [[PORPDT-536] VKD Removal of Ready-to-Watch (Sehbereitschaft) Section - Part II (770375) - DE Jira|https://de.jira.agile.vodafone.com/browse/PORPDT-536]  anyway, so maybe it is not worth it to push OSF to do it, even though it is clearly still faulty Omnius-behaviour.

We are now not displaying the technician section when booking KIP only or KIP+TV.

For this reason, the technician state cannot leak from KIP to TV anymore (or rather, it will leak over, but it doesn't matter anymore).

Could you please re-test and confirm?;;;","30/Jan/25 6:22 PM;tobias.pohlmann@vodafone.com;The root problem persists – the KIP technician state is not updated when changes in the TV package are made. However, the business case changed on cable side with PORPDT-536, so that now, both for KIP-only customer as well as TV+KIP customer we do not want to show any section.

 ;;;","09/Jul/24 6:41 PM;vishal.raut@vodafone.com;Hi all,

FYI as discussed in call, 
All the required data (OIL Logs, OSE logs, Lumen logs) has been shared with Waseem for further investigation.

Waseem will check and Sandeep will update for further action that needs to be done. ;;;","10/Jul/24 5:09 PM;gauri.bhagat@vodafone.com;Below are some of the findings after the call with Waseem,

It has impact ONLY IF all three switches are Yes If anyone of them is No then there is no impact. We have checked in PROD all three switches are set to 'No' So ACC team cannot decide for PROD, decision has to take by Fusion C team if they want Switches Yes. ;;;","10/Jul/24 6:57 PM;sandeepkumar.pradhan@vodafone.com;Hi All,

{*}Why issue Occurred{*}: Since all the 3 field for CustomerDataHUB Solution1 Settings and CustomerDataHUB Settings  such as

CustomerDataHUB Solution1 Settings 
1)Central Search ES Interfaces Enabled

CustomerDataHUB Settings
1)Legacy search and MRT Enabled
2)Enable CDH Interface
are set to ""Yes"" which breaks the API flow in current OSE build  which is not the case in ACC1 or PROD
in both these environment at least one of the them or all are set as ""NO"" where both customer search and Installed base working fine (for PRODUCTION all filed set as NO)


{*}Action plan{*}: we need to work with Vodafone design team to understand on what criteria these all filed need to switch on (Set as yes) after that or parallelly we need look from OSE prospective how we can handle these API irrespective of setting (all 3 set to YES or all 3 set to NO(working condition) or partial set of YES and NO (working condition))
 

Also PROD and ACC2 are almost equal we should ensure that ACC2 setting always same that of PROD else conf change leads to issue like this , Do understand that tACC2 setting can be change too for testing but it has to be known to an extent;;;","11/Jul/24 12:02 PM;ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com;[~sandeepkumar.pradhan@vodafone.com]  the settings on ACC and in PROD will never be exactly same, as we are always testing future topics in ACC which might not be live yet.
However, for these Fusion C switches we had topics in scope for different releases, so the functionality itself is live since a long time but with a technical go live.

1)[OS-8975] SOL0 - Search & display customer with product(s) mastered in solstice - Vodafone Global Jira -> implemented with Wave 7.0, tested with Wave 7.1  

2) [OS-11283] SOL1SE32 - Extending the OSF Search for Solstice Customers - Vodafone Global Jira -> initially implemented with Wave 7.2, because of needed enhancement tested again with Wave 9.0 

We are not having any new functionality, the switches are there since years. 
To retest your TechM fix for OS-56961 of course all switches had to be YES and in release Wave 9.0 they have been on YES in general most of the time, as OS-11283 was part of Wave 9.0 and tested by Fusion C team.

As ACC1 was used for Wave 8.2 of course ACC1 was different, as there only OS-8975 was live already (therefore only one switch was enabled) 

And as its technically live, Fusion C team can decide at any time to switch it ON in production. Its like any other technical go live, where functionaly is enabled in ACC but not yet in production.;;;","12/Jul/24 2:24 PM;ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com;Workaround: We have switched OFF SOL1 search for now, Fusion C team was informed about the situation and asked for solution / change

This can be either fixed by disabling the CDH sol1 search (elastic search) or increasing the threshold of displayed customers in the admin setting UI. fyi [~peter.nestvogel@vodafone.com];;;","22/Jul/24 4:56 PM;ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com;Internal TechM call with C1/Fusion is planned to discuss on further handling of this defect ;;;","12/Aug/24 8:31 PM;ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com;[~vikash.saurav@vodafone.com]  we need an update on this ticket to know how to handle the fusion C switch for extended search ;;;","22/Aug/24 4:03 PM;ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com;Talked to Vikas today, team wants to reproduce the issue on ACC2. Therefore we would need to activate the Fusion C search for some time, this needs to be aligned with [~gauri.bhagat@vodafone.com]  / [~ajay.bhavar@vodafone.com] ;;;","27/Aug/24 7:14 PM;akhilesh.sawarkar@vodafone.com;We attempted to replicate this in the ACC2 environment with Shweta and Sneha, and it appears that the CS API is functioning properly for both Fixed and Cable with all CDH interfaces enabled (which means all three switches are set to 'Yes').

Hi All.

We delivered a debug patch for this issue to ACC1 on 17/12 under the reference CN#KIAS2000_CN_18936 however that debug patch didn’t help much to fix the issue and also didn’t indicate reason for failed again so we are validating further more on it, Soon we will update the action plan and that action plan include is to validate with API expert to Fastrack this issue resolution.,;;;","20/Dec/24 2:12 PM;daniel.loos@vodafone.com;regarding this specific error message, please be aware that enabling the extended search will also enable this unrelated setting in the default configuration:

after the call today we can see that the flow is on standBy because no customer id is sent to ogw.

Checked OSE/OGW calls where correct BEW update version with customer id is sent at UM backend where in Cable logs we see the request getting sent to UM via Minerva asking to update Version 4-- but somehow it seems UM is not updating Version 4 at their end - PFA SS for reference
For detail analysis check we need UM team support to check for this issue;;;","02/Jul/24 3:14 PM;rohan.kumbhar@vodafone.com; !screenshot-1.png|thumbnail!

;;;","04/Jul/24 6:28 PM;rohan.kumbhar@vodafone.com;As per the latest call on BEW topic.. there is a design GAP for the BEW flows which needs to be discussed by VF Design team.
as of now the problem here for this flow is that in the GetCustomerDetails Mode 3 call Omnius is always receiving BEWVersion as ""0"" irrespective of any other version is sent from OSF. So there is no checks nor validation of this BEW version at legacy backend and everytime Cable/UM will send Version 0 only.
So this is a design gap and currently this defect needs to be kept ON_HOLD until further clarification;;;","09/Jul/24 3:00 PM;ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com;[~rohan.kumbhar@vodafone.com]  who is taking this point now to discuss about unitymedia?
As its not only BEW only Retail which is not wroking, but also not for Telesales new customers in case its not IPCC triggered, and Retail new customers have never been tested.

So a general discussion is required?;;;","11/Jul/24 7:56 PM;ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com;[~rohan.kumbhar@vodafone.com]  based on the latest calls e have the following findings for Retail BEW and unitymedia in general

1) New customer, Retail, order + BEW -> Backend receives and stores BEW correctly

2) Existing customer, Retail, order + BEW -> Backend receives and stores BEW correctly

3) Existing customer, Retail, BEW only ->{color:#de350b} *Backend receives and stores BEW correctly? Please confirm this*
{color:#172b4d}What is wrong in all cases -> Frontend OSF is not able to retrieve the right BEW settings. So if BEW was updated in UNitymedia backend, Frontend is not reflecting this. It still looks like no BEW is set{color} ** 
{color:#172b4d}We will also compare the same for VKD, how Retrievecustomerinfo Mode 3 related to BEW permissions is looking like{color}{color};;;","12/Jul/24 3:20 PM;rohan.kumbhar@vodafone.com;As per latest observation it seems that Problem is happening only for the Unity Media customers when they chose BEW Options.
We tried 1 Cable New acquisition where BEW were correctly updated at backend and then we tried to fetch the same customer on OSF portal where correct Version status was reflected in GetCustomerDetails call and also BEW Button was disabled.

;;;","12/Jul/24 7:08 PM;ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com;[~rohan.kumbhar@vodafone.com]  the ticket itself is only for Unitymedia, so for VKD its not a problem and no ticket reported.

We still need to document here, if the Existing customer, Retail, BEW only for Unitymedia is reaching the backend as ticket says 

_*{color:#de350b}BEW version is not updating in Unity Backend{color}* and BEW Erfassen is enable even after update the version._

 

At the moment we assume, BEW version is getting updated in Unity backend, but we cannot retrieve the GetPermissions because its not giving back the correct version 
Unitymedia is handling permissions with Version 2, OGW expecting Version  4 and for retrieval of existing permissions we get Version 0.

Needs to be checked with responsible person from MinervaAdapter (VKD side);;;","17/Jul/24 2:34 PM;ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com;No progress yet as we did not identify the responsible person who can help with Minerva Adapter VKD ;;;","18/Jul/24 9:28 PM;ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com;I have enclosed the latest discussion.
As per latest analysis this problem is related to the way back from Unitymedia via Minerva Adapter VKD to OGW

{color:#de350b}*OK:*{color} OGW version 4 -> Minerva Adapter maps Version 4 from the VKD request into Version 2 for the request to UME/VFW -> UME/VFW is storing Version 2 correctly in Mood and showing right entries in RNS for the customer 

{color:#00875a}*Not OK*{color}: Now when we open the customer who has given BEW again in OSF, we expect that the stored BEW is taken and we are not asked to capture BEW again. Problem: For this get_permission Call we are receiving version 0 for the mentioned scenarios and we cannot map this version to our valid Version 4 (not OK)

{+}*Gap*{+}: We need a Mapping: UME/VFW is sending back Version 2 to Minerva Adapter-> Minerva Adapter maps Version 2 to Version 4 if getpermission request is coming from OGW

 

I have shared the feedback also with Jörg Trierweiler, Thomas Schneider, Andreas Baldermann and few more people to verify.
This is a general topic and not specifically related to BEW only Retail Epic
Waiting for feedback about possible next steps;;;","11/Aug/24 5:06 PM;ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com;I did not receive an answer yet from the experts how to handle this defect. However, I remind them again (Due to vacation might need some time until they reply).

 ;;;","14/Nov/24 9:53 AM;nina.pickl@vodafone.com;The new PCAT change with the new logic for ILS flows has been delivered to ACC1(Prodnear Env) and tested successfully by Franz and Simon with 4 different scenarios (see description below)

 

[~gokul.vade@vodafone.com]  [~ajay.bhavar@vodafone.com]

this ACC tracking Bug can now be retestet on ACC1 with the *+2nd scenario+* ->{+}{+}no Insurance option should be visible(see description below)

Existing customers on ACC1 they can be used for the retest:
|Customer ID|Subscriber Number|Tariff Option|SOC|
|104724208|GSM1738852612|GM1LH30 |24HATAV17|

|104058520|GSM1727077848|SMART3XXL|24HATAV17|

 

*(*)New Change(*)*

*+1st scenario:+*

SOC “sales expired” -> user with existing Legacy/Cover/Cover Plus insurance, which is no longer offered + Vodafone device, which was purchased no longer than 120 days ago

Expected result: Customer can book VC and VCP (with SOC “sales expired” = true)

Expected result: User cannot book VC and VCP (with SOC “sales expired” = true)

Required existing customer: Contract with HW (purchase >120 days) & tariff + Legacy/Cover/CoverPlus SOC “sales expired” = true

 

*+3rd scenario:+*

Without a fix the feature can not be deployed into production.{color}

 

Test data:

Browser: Chrome
Environment: ACC1 
Channel: Telesales + Retail

Steps to reproduce the issue:
 - Enter address: Goethestr. 27 26409 Wittmund Wittmund
 - Select package: ""Kabel Internet & Phone""
 - Select tariff: ""[3BV:B09] GigaZuhause 250 Kabel, 1.-9. Monat 19,99 €""
 - Select goody on ""Gutschriften und Aktionen"" section: ""[JL5] Gutschrift GigaZuhause Young: 1.-9. Monat: 0 €, 10.-24. Monat: -5 €, danach 0 €""
 - open basket

The prices are not calculated as expected.
As a consequence of the wrong basket also the contract summary is incorrect.

!image-2024-04-10-18-00-56-136.png|width=856,height=463!  

+Pre-Analyses of product configuration team:+
OSF uses the 'Price sliding' field from the Product Catalog to configure the way the price periods are shown in the frontend:

!screenshot-1.png|width=338,height=226!

The numbers in this field are however interpreted as absolute points in time. They should however be interpreted as relative time intervals.

+Concretely this means:+

Price sliding '9:6:' should be interpreted as 0.-9. month, 10.-15. month, 16. month onward.
Currently it is interpreted as 0.-9. month, 0.-6. month, whatever comes afterward.
This obviously does not make any sense, since the second period ends before the first one, so the consequence in the frontend is, that the second period is ignored.

+The obvious fix therefore is:+
The numbers in the ""Price sliding"" field should always be interpreted as *relative time* intervalls.

 

+Additional proof:+
When checking in the OSF Backoffice for the product properties, the price_sliding of JL5 looks like this:

!image-2024-04-09-15-34-39-869.png!

Looking at this in overview in the frontend, the second time intervall seems to be ignored:

!image-2024-04-10-18-00-56-136.png|width=423,height=229!

Manually changing it to 15 then leads to the following view in OSF:

!image-2024-04-09-15-42-29-039.png|width=737,height=206!

This is, however, still wrong. OSF seems to tread the numbers in the PCAT import as absolute times instead of relative intervals

=> Three sliding prices are in principle possible to show, but the configuration in the product setup is imported and interpreted wrongly",,alka.kshirsagar2@vodafone.com,ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com,atharva.paskanthi@vodafone.com,gaurav.lanjewar1@vodafone.com,gokul.vade@vodafone.com,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,OAF-762,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"02/May/24 12:50 PM;stephanie.krammer@vodafone.com;OSF Incident Ticket - CRImprovement notwendig - OS-54646 OSF  ACC1  Wave 8.2  sliding prices are not interpreted as expected - Vodafone Global Jira.msg;https://jira.sp.vodafone.com/secure/attachment/1281954/OSF+Incident+Ticket+-+CRImprovement+notwendig+-+OS-54646+OSF++ACC1++Wave+8.2++sliding+prices+are+not+interpreted+as+expected+-+Vodafone+Global+Jira.msg","10/Apr/24 9:33 PM;stephanie.krammer@vodafone.com;image-2024-04-09-15-34-39-869.png;https://jira.sp.vodafone.com/secure/attachment/1267853/image-2024-04-09-15-34-39-869.png","10/Apr/24 9:34 PM;stephanie.krammer@vodafone.com;image-2024-04-09-15-42-29-039.png;https://jira.sp.vodafone.com/secure/attachment/1267854/image-2024-04-09-15-42-29-039.png","10/Apr/24 9:30 PM;stephanie.krammer@vodafone.com;image-2024-04-10-18-00-56-136.png;https://jira.sp.vodafone.com/secure/attachment/1267849/image-2024-04-10-18-00-56-136.png","11/Apr/24 12:55 PM;stephanie.krammer@vodafone.com;pcat-without-fix.tar.xz;https://jira.sp.vodafone.com/secure/attachment/1268028/pcat-without-fix.tar.xz","10/Apr/24 9:32 PM;stephanie.krammer@vodafone.com;screenshot-1.png;https://jira.sp.vodafone.com/secure/attachment/1267851/screenshot-1.png",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,The issue is a show stopper for the Go Live of Young Promotion feature which is planned for April Main Release 29.04,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,OS-49399,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"v9.18.5-BB1 2024-04-02 06:59 |04-09|21-54",Fixed with CR826 in Wave 9.2 release ,,Cable,,Omnius,ACC,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Green,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"0|i9j9qv:",9223372036854775807,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Backlog - UNCOVERED,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Code,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,TechM -> PCAT,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"11/Apr/24 11:55 AM;ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com;[~vikash.saurav@vodafone.com]  [~bharath.krishnamurthy@vodafone.com]  please check this on priority, if you need a call to discuss the details we can organize it but we need to be fast.

yes, currently the fix is almost ready after discussions with design team and Ketaki.

in this fix the 24 retry will not be in use anymore, instead the retry will be determined by the ogw_error_handler table.

it will decide how many times to retry, and how much time to wait between the calls.

for this flow the retry will be active for empty response from oneDMS or OGWERR-9900 error code return

for example:
this is a record from the table:

{
    ""ERROR_CODE"":""OGWERR-9900"",
    ""ERROR_CATEGORY"":""Technical"",
    ""IGNORE_ERROR_IND"":""N"",
    ""RETRYABLE_IND"":""TRUE"",
    ""MAX_RETRY_TIMES"":""3"",
    ""RETRY_WAIT_TIME"":""10"",
    ""MAX_WAIT_TIME"":null,
    ""STATUS_TO_SET"":null,
    ""CHANNEL"":""TELESALES"",
    ""SERVICE_CALL"":""ASYNC"",
    ""SERVICE_NAME"":""OneDMS""
}
so the flow will retry 3 times and the wait time will be 10 seconds between every try.;;;","16/May/24 4:05 PM;ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com;informed [~kirill.leibov1@vodafone.com]  to get in touch with Ran to discuss if the solution is ok from vodafone side;;;","17/May/24 1:34 PM;kirill.leibov1@vodafone.com;The existing solution with 24 tries must be {+}not removed{+}, but it shall remain as the +default+ behavior in the case, that we do not have no configuration in the ogw_error_handler table.;;;","19/May/24 1:34 PM;ran.farjun1@vodafone.com;thanks Kiril,

This is the answer from Raniero:

You need to check with OSF, this is what OSF is sending:
and OSF is sending a request for an UM customer (BW = Baden Württenberg).

This is a urn for a VKD customer:

This is a urn for a UM customer:

!image-2024-02-07-12-09-00-539.png!

In SoapUI you are sending a request for a VKD customer, OSF sends a request for an UM customer.

Could you please check that again? Thanks;;;","07/Feb/24 5:33 PM;vikash.saurav@vodafone.com;Divya Kumbla added a comment -
 
 
Hi [~natasa.dimovic1@vodafone.com]  ,Again the decision of whether the customer is VKD or UM is based on AccountCategory in getCustomerResult for index search

and Region in retrieveCustomerInfo mode1 for Legacysearch.

For reference

!image-2024-02-07-17-32-45-292.png!

So we need to check what is coming for this customer for which you need to share the search response and mode1 response logs.;;;","07/Feb/24 6:06 PM;natasa.dimovic1@vodafone.com;Hi [~vikash.saurav@vodafone.com] please find attached the logs;;;","08/Feb/24 1:12 PM;vikash.saurav@vodafone.com;Divya Kumbla added a comment -
 
Hi [~natasa.dimovic1@vodafone.com] 

As said earlier the region from mode1 decides if its VKD or UM, and as per attached logs we receive region as UME-KBW hence OSE considers it as UM customer.

 * Derive customer stack from GlobalID prefix (""legacy stack"")  instead of address region
 * IF improvements required as this is only known by OGW (Omnius can only see LK_ from linked customers) - e.g. introducing new attribute to indicate customers product stack:
 * CustomerSearch()
 * getCustomerDetails()

Hi [~ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com]  ,

I don't see the steps to reproduce and if its for existing customer we need mode logs and serviceability logs between OSE<->OIL & OIL<->OGW.

Thanks

[~alka.kshirsagar2@vodafone.com] fyi;;;","24/Jan/24 3:56 PM;ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com;[~vikash.saurav@vodafone.com]  I was not creating any order, I am just scanning portal UI tool from time to time to find unidentified issues. And within this quality check I have found tickets with this error message. 

 

After some analysis I have identified, that it seems to be this scenario:

-> Search existing unitymedia customer and perform Move to VKD adress 

 

this is example Order ID from ACC1 - it failed with 2 sky tickets

One ticket because of invalid VPKN (issue is solved, please ignore that) and second sky ticket was for setpermission.


Unfortunately Sky ticket were cleared in between so I am not able to find my two tickets anymore..... But hopefully you can reproduce on your environment for a Move from Unity to VKD.

Seems like in this case the existing customer ID from unity is taken over, instead of recognizing that customer will get a new customer ID from VKD for Move scenario

 

Order ID 782545, Customer ID 1009755201 (initial customer before Move) 

!image-2024-01-24-11-21-17-927.png!

 

Same seems to happen when moving from Unity Cable to DSL product. 

So please check flow Unity Cable to VKD Cable Move, and Unity Cable to DSL Move

 ;;;","25/Jan/24 5:24 PM;ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com;We have placed another order yesterday.

*Move from Unity Cable to VKD Cable* with permission selection in checkout.
Omnius Order ID 783467

 

In SetPermission Call I see that its called for Cable - {*}UN{*}, but the target customer is VKD Customer after Move. 



So I would expect in the setpermission call that system is calling VKD with new VKD customer ID, right? It does not make sense to store a permission in unitymedia backend when the customer is going to be inactive there, and will be active only in VKD in the future with new customer ID

Hi [~ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com]  ,

Further based on investigation above is the expected behavior. Which means for the existing customer we are getting the region value from Install Base and if region value which is from the IB or from the serviceability(in ACQ) is not matching with the below table data which is agreed during the design, then OSE send empty <CustomerList><CustomerDetails>{*}<TargetSystem>{*}.

If for any new region value VF expects to send *TargetSystem* value then it has to be added to OSE via SRT

[~ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com] I think the behaviour by OSF that the error message is shown in case a inconsistent technician selection is made by the agent can be assumed to be correct. I at least would not know what the expected outcome of such a selection would be.

The following part from your comment could be the solution to this:
{panel}
*BUT this is not expected as per Ticket from PROD:*

This means the option for TV is not visible anymore, if I got it right. Therefore there can also not be any mismatch between TV and KIP installation options.

Your assumption regarding the TV section then not being visible is correct.

From our tests I would also assume that the TV section shouldn't be visible in this case [Quelle von vkdTechnicianOptions.feature - productSetup - webgit (kabeldeutschland.de)|https://webgit.kabeldeutschland.de/projects/FE/repos/productsetup/browse/4DevelopmentOnly/tests/unified/features/availability/vkdTechnicianOptions.feature#239-259]:

I double checked in our logs and attached them here as well (cable rules artifact logs), maybe they help.
The scenario I clicked was:

 * open kip package
 * open (new) mobile package

 * create the bundle by clicking the bundle drawer
 * go to checkout -> see message
 * logs of this state: [^cable_rules_artifact_OS47914_pre_workaround.log]
 * open kip package
 * select any option and deselect it again
 * logs of this state:
[^cable_rules_artifact_OS47914_post_workaround.log]

When checking the logs notice that no posting rules are executed after the bundle is created and before the workaround is applied.

Hi Alexander/Simon,

This is not a code issue I have checked working PCAT with the ACC1/ACC2 codebase in my local environment and it's working fine, seems something wrong with the ACC2 PCAT.

I have checked Rules manager and some differences found in the rules also in both the PCAT's so both PCT’s are not same.

*ACC1:*
Total Rules: 73185 
Mobile: 62760
KIP Ruls: 5168
KABLE TV Rules: 4450

The problem is, that ACC2 is having January catalogue since today, as PST is testing next release. So maybe first of all the issue has to be reproducable with new catalogue. Maybe we have to bring PST Team and TechM together to get it clarified ;;;","11/Dec/23 6:53 PM;simon.auch@vodafone.com;[~bharath.krishnamurthy@vodafone.com]  could you please in detail explain what you tested?

Hi Alexander/Simon,
 
 For extended shopping cart min max equal warning rules, there is not relation with cable post rule results or execution.
The rule which is problematic, is a max(0) rule and service to category rule. So if this rule’s service source expression evaluates to true than it will check if cart have max 0 number of products only from the target category. So if product OMNIUSTVCHANGEDMARKER is not part of the package then problematic rule service source expression will evaluate to true and further it will show warning if from target category we have more then 0 products in cart.;;;","14/Dec/23 2:55 PM;simon.auch@vodafone.com;Hi [~bharath.krishnamurthy@vodafone.com],

the relation is implicit, the posting rules select the OMNIUSTVCHANGEDMARKER once there is any change to the package. OSF needs to call the posting rules after any change to cable packages including bundle rules.

*OSF has to call the posting rules after any change to a cable package, otherwise inconsistencies regarding products/orders/etc are to be expected.* ;;;","14/Dec/23 3:30 PM;ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com;[~simon.auch@vodafone.com]  is there any story about this behavior ""{*}OSF has to call the posting rules after any change to a cable package, otherwise inconsistencies regarding products/orders/etc are to be expected.{*} "" so we can see that it was exactly requested in this way from OSF Software?;;;","14/Dec/23 3:30 PM;bharath.krishnamurthy@vodafone.com;[~johannes-alexander.dengler@vodafone.com] [~simon.auch@vodafone.com]

Hi Alexander/Simon,
 
The logic implemented long back cannot be modified as it may cause additional adversary problems. However, if you require this logic to be changed, it will require the involvement of design team.;;;","14/Dec/23 4:54 PM;simon.auch@vodafone.com;[~ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com], I am not sure if there was any more specific documentation (I will keep searching for a bit), but the following HLD already has a section:
|*Cable artifact rules*
 
The Cable Catalog and PLM colleagues have requested their own rules engine to be applied in the configurator. This is realised with a plugin development where Cable colleagues can upload their Rules Artifact as part of the PLM process. This Rules Artifact consists of the same Sales Rules (in PHP language/cable-speak) that is used currently in ECC front-ends. OMNIUS will share the full-shoppingcart (all packages) to the Rules Artifact, the rules artifact will process ruling, and return the shoppingcart object with modified cable orderlines in Kabel TV, KIP and KUD packages to be displayed in OMNIUS. The Rules Artifact will be called both before a product is selected (on show of configurator, pre-condition) {*}as well as after selecting a product (on adding to the shoppingcart, post-condition){*}. OMNIUS will not be able to have special GUI handling like for internal OMNIUS sales rules when using the Artifact.|

Highlighting added by me.

From a slightly newer HLD:
|Apart from the Omnius compatibility rules for cable, specific precondition and postcondition rules from cable are also evaluated within the Cable Rules Artifact. *With each change in the configurator (for cable products) the Omnius rules and Cable rules artifact are evaluated in a loop, until a stable state is reached.* |

As explained in the call (and in previous comments on this ticket):

the checkout is blocked by a rule that comes from the pcat because the product OMNIUSTVCHANGEDMARKER is not selected.
the product is added by the posting rules of the cable rules artifact if there is any change to the TV package
after the bundle is created the TV package is changed as it now contains VB4
as checked in the logs: the posting rules are not called by OSF after the bundle is created

OSF has to call the posting rules after any change to a cable package, otherwise inconsistencies regarding products/orders/etc are to be expected.

The very first analysis was by me and as far as I can tell nothing in the comments suggests that the assumptions I had were analysed?

For the result of my analysis see the first comment [OS-47333] OSF Wave 8.1 ACC2 - Contract Summary: Price of old TV Product is missing (only OSF) - Vodafone Global Jira.

I also checked again for a random customer having this product that the inventory returned by vkdgateway does indeed contain a price.

TL;DR:

This behaviour is reproducible with a vast range of PCAT versions (basically any version containing UMDKLM should suffice).

The product has no price configured, but for (unity) inventory products the price from the inventory must be used. 
VkdGateway correctly returns a price in the inventory of the customer.

Hi [~devi.jampana@vodafone.com]  , This is product configuration issue, I have compared working and not working (UMDKIM and UMDKLM) SKU’s in BO and matched the configuration and it’s working fine now in ST.

please check once on ACC BO

We checked with old customer and the issue still exists

We are placing one new order in backend and check whether the pricing has changed or not

srujana;;;","21/Feb/24 4:22 PM;devi.jampana@vodafone.com;Hi [~ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com]  [~simon.auch@vodafone.com] 

We had a call with TechM team to analyse this defect Further and got the below information from them

They compared the back office configuration between one failed scenario(Digitaler Kabelanschluss m. Service ) and pass scenario(Digital Kabelanschluss)

and made the below changes to their environment to check whether it is working with failed scenario:

 

*1.They tried to change the price of the failed product and product frontend visibilty of the failed product same as the Passed one*

i.e They changed the price of Digitaler Kabelanschluss m. Service from 0 to 20,99 in BO and product Visibility as below (Previously only inverntory is selected for thiis product)  

!image-2024-02-21-16-15-22-390.png|width=288,height=56!

 

!image-2024-02-21-16-14-57-020.png|width=330,height=141!

And then when checked in front end , We are able to see the product details in front end 

 

*2. As we mentioned that price of the Unity Product should not be taken from Back Office*

To check this one , they tried to change one product price from 20,99 to 20 euros in back office in their environment 

When checked in front end , we are able to see the product price has changed from 20,99 to 20 Euros

!image-2024-02-21-16-20-15-601.png|width=718,height=118!

 

Kindly let us know whether this behaviour is correct?

Or may be we should have a call with PCAT and TechM together to discuss on this issue

 

Regards

 ;;;","21/Feb/24 4:43 PM;ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com;Hi [~devi.jampana@vodafone.com]  I think the product digitaler Kabelanschluss mit Service should have a flexible price depending on the adress and not a strict price. But not sure if this is still true, it was true in the past. So I think that the prices is not maintained in backoffice, but as mentioned from [~simon.auch@vodafone.com] :
-> price of inventory products must be taken from the inventory of the customer _not_ from the catalog in OSF. As already mentioned in a previous comment by me, the inventory call contains the correct price for the product in question ;;;","22/Feb/24 12:29 PM;devi.jampana@vodafone.com;Hi [~vikash.saurav@vodafone.com]

[~devi.jampana@vodafone.com] 

As discussed there is no such handling for this usecase; where Overriding of PCAT price with Customer Ibase for any product.

In Omnius; it always consider customer’s Ibase product price from pcat RMM(reverse Multimapped) or via (service all {{{}GetNonStandardRates{}}})

So this is not a defect ruther i would say it must be CR to have such behaviour handle in Omnius.

I am not the correct person to decide if this is a bug or not, but I also have not heard of any past CRs to change this behaviour.

As [~markus.meissner@vodafone.com] is the application owner of OSF I assume he should be able to provide the necessary decision if a CR should be created for this issue.
If such a CR is to be created I can support from cable side with the relevant endpoints and documentation for them.

(ABK = Yes or No) and *YES* has only scope if there is *Technician needed* dropdown option possible then make this option preset in readonly AND also not add chargeable product in SC.

Can you please look into the below comment

 

Regards

Srujana;;;","20/Sep/23 4:07 PM;simon.auch@vodafone.com;This can be changed on cable side, but I am relatively sure that this was never implemented for Unity.

Without CR-716 the agent could select both ""Anschluss ist bereits sehbereit"" or ""Anschluss ist nicht sehbereit"" but only ""Anschluss ist bereits sehbereit"" would actually do anything (selecting a marker product).

With CR-716 only the option with a valid product selection is left, but functionally everything behaves just like before.
The agent basically just had the illusion of a choice before.

If this behaviour should be changed I think it needs to be clarified if there are other cases for unity in which (at a self install address) the option ""Anschluss ist nicht sehbereit"" should be selectable. The other ES* products come to mind for example.;;;","22/Sep/23 4:50 PM;nina.pickl@vodafone.com;In clarification:

the technician option should be shown if KIP only is booked or is there an exception when booking ES5? If yes, then I would say the wrong option is displayed.

as I understood it, the technician section should never be shown for a KIP-only booking.

In the excel sheet, there are only 2 cases left in which we want to show the section in OSF, which are both TV-only cases.
!image-2025-02-03-08-44-34-740.png|width=1339,height=527!

For this use case, described in the description, the technician option is still displayed in the Access Details.

We are not sure if everything has already been implemented.

If everything has already been implemented then I would suggest to reject this bug. A new bug should be created then. Could you please check if there is maybe a bug on Cable side? Thank you;;;","03/Feb/25 1:33 PM;tobias.pohlmann@vodafone.com;Ah, okay, now I get it.

The reason why it happens here is that this is a Unity address which historically was treated similarly, but differently than VKD with the technician options.

*Open questions from my perspective:*
 * which products exactly control the display of the tv access details in OSF?
 ** Is it only TECYESTV and TECNOTV or also products like VP0, 1V1?
 ** Is this controlled by special tags on products or categories, or are the products hardcoded in OSF?
Maybe [~vikash.saurav@vodafone.com] can answer this question?
 * If the display of the checkout part is only controlled by TECYESTV and TECNOTV, this will not work (and from cable side never should have) for Unity, since these two products are not aligned and should never be available for Unity.
Which TV technician option should be bookable in Unity TV scenarios? As far as I am aware there is no TV technician product that is available in the Unity footprint.
 *  in which scenarios should which technician option be bookable in OSF?

 * 
 ** we have a list of ~80 test cases. Some of these are apparently not correct.
 ** Who can go through these test cases with us and determine which of them need to be changed?
 ** Without at least a contact person that can answer this question it will not make sense to start implementation of this ticket.

If this worked before, then:

1) the display of the section does not only depend on TECHNOTV or TECHYESTV in VFW cases and/or

2) the OSF behaviour controlling this section in VFW scenarios changed

If we are following the below steps in ACC2 then we are able to see the Access details even now:

Steps:

1)select TV Product and KIP section 

2)select the TV Product

3)Donot select any product in KIP

4)Move forward it will throw an error that we have to select the KIP Product in check out section

5)Go back and select the KIP Product now

6)Move forward and fill customer details

7)Then we are able to see the access details for TV

Note:we tried this steps 3 to 4 times and we are able to see the access details once

Strange behaviour

This issue can be related to any VKD Permissions?

Srujana;;;","28/Sep/23 8:02 PM;simon.auch@vodafone.com;Hi Devi & Nina,

[~devi.jampana@vodafone.com] for now I would ignore the case you had and focus on the scenario described in the ticket: a TV order without KIP.
I think my initial question is still unanswered:
When does OSF show the access details section for TV in a unity scenario?

If the answer to this question is ""when at least one product in the technician_needed_no or technician_needed_yes category is visible according to the cable product logic"" then the next question we need answered is why was the section shown in previous versions?

[~nina.pickl@vodafone.com] could you figure out a version where this worked last time?;;;","28/Sep/23 8:18 PM;simon.auch@vodafone.com;According to an answer from Vikash in another ticket [OS-42115] OSF | ACC2 | Wave 8.1 | CR716 Futurize regression defect | when booking KIP and TV the access details for TV are not displayed - Vodafone Global Jira
""It is hard to give an exact timing for this feature since it seems to have been implemented a long time ago. I recommend contact with Vodafone BA for more information.
Unity Media works exactly the same as normal Kable TV and KIP products to display the access details section."".
To me this is a direct conflict to the information that this ever worked in the (recent) past.
Without a specific version in which it worked before I have the feeling this discussing is not leading anywhere.

If we want to change this we need a requirement from Business regarding which tv technician options to align for unity or accept that the tv access details are not shown in unity cases.;;;","29/Sep/23 12:27 PM;nina.pickl@vodafone.com;Hi [~simon.auch@vodafone.com],

 ;;;","17/Oct/23 3:05 PM;simon.auch@vodafone.com;Hi Devi,

I have no clue what OSF is doing here, but definitely not how it should behave to the best of my knowledge.
I could reproduce the issue and make the following two screenshots:
!image-2023-10-17-11-31-41-319.png!
!image-2023-10-17-11-32-04-497.png!

Which shows that OSF thinks that 1V1/VP0/TECYESTV/TECNOTV should be selected. That is not correct since the last execution of the cable product logic up to that point in the checkout process returns none of these 4 products as visible.
For completeness I attached the log of the session up to the dropdown in the checkout: [^cable_rules_artifact_OS42066.log]

Please find out when the access details are shown in the checkout. All information until now seems to conflict with the unity case. Maybe there is a special handling for unity addresses hardcoded in OSF?;;;","19/Oct/23 11:57 AM;ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com;Hi [~simon.auch@vodafone.com]  

regarding ""All information until now seems to conflict with the unity case"" -> for CR716 we have raised also defects for VKD and not only for Unity, so something is in general wrong in this access details section.

As the latest observation happened after having new broadvision product catalogue in place, should we raise a defect against CR756? Or against Product catalogue?
I do not want to mix this defect here with behavior shown for broadvision products, otherwise will be even more confusing;;;","19/Oct/23 1:20 PM;simon.auch@vodafone.com;Hi Ariadne,
maybe it was not clear what I meant with ""All information until now seems to conflict with the unity case"":
 * We have multiple answers (in this ticket and in other tickets) saying that TECNOTV and TECYESTV control the display of the section (and did so in the past)

 * 
 ** this can't be the case for unity as those are not aligned products
 * In other answers it was mentioned that it is controlled not by TECNOTV and TECYESTV but by categories containing TECNOTV, TECYESTV, 1V1, VP0
 ** sound better, but also all of these products are not aligned and should never have been orderable for unity

In the newly encountered behaviour by Devi (https://jira.sp.vodafone.com/browse/OS-42066?focusedId=2974883&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels:comment-tabpanel#comment-2974883) suddenly the access details are shown. Even though TECNOTV , TECYESTV, VP0, and 1V1 are not bookable according to cable product logic?

Someone has to look into the OSE source code and check _systematically_ when this section is shown. I expect there to be _something_ hardcoded for VFW, but I cannot check that myself.

Without an explanation from OSE side when this section is shown I don't know how else to help with this defect. If it is supposed to be based on the orderability of specific categories {_}then the new behaviour is a OSE contradicts it because no product from that category is orderable in the scenario clicked by me{_}. So for starters this could be analysed and maybe we get some insight which logic we are missing from OSE.
