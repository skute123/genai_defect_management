Test data:

Browser: Chrome
Environment: ACC1 
Channel: Telesales + Retail

Steps to reproduce the issue:
 - Enter address: Goethestr. 27 26409 Wittmund Wittmund
 - Select package: ""Kabel Internet & Phone""
 - Select tariff: ""[3BV:B09] GigaZuhause 250 Kabel, 1.-9. Monat 19,99 €""
 - Select goody on ""Gutschriften und Aktionen"" section: ""[JL5] Gutschrift GigaZuhause Young: 1.-9. Monat: 0 €, 10.-24. Monat: -5 €, danach 0 €""
 - open basket

The prices are not calculated as expected.
As a consequence of the wrong basket also the contract summary is incorrect.

!image-2024-04-10-18-00-56-136.png|width=856,height=463!  

+Pre-Analyses of product configuration team:+
OSF uses the 'Price sliding' field from the Product Catalog to configure the way the price periods are shown in the frontend:

!screenshot-1.png|width=338,height=226!

The numbers in this field are however interpreted as absolute points in time. They should however be interpreted as relative time intervals.

+Concretely this means:+

Price sliding '9:6:' should be interpreted as 0.-9. month, 10.-15. month, 16. month onward.
Currently it is interpreted as 0.-9. month, 0.-6. month, whatever comes afterward.
This obviously does not make any sense, since the second period ends before the first one, so the consequence in the frontend is, that the second period is ignored.

+The obvious fix therefore is:+
The numbers in the ""Price sliding"" field should always be interpreted as *relative time* intervalls.

 

+Additional proof:+
When checking in the OSF Backoffice for the product properties, the price_sliding of JL5 looks like this:

!image-2024-04-09-15-34-39-869.png!

Looking at this in overview in the frontend, the second time intervall seems to be ignored:

!image-2024-04-10-18-00-56-136.png|width=423,height=229!

Manually changing it to 15 then leads to the following view in OSF:

!image-2024-04-09-15-42-29-039.png|width=737,height=206!

This is, however, still wrong. OSF seems to tread the numbers in the PCAT import as absolute times instead of relative intervals

=> Three sliding prices are in principle possible to show, but the configuration in the product setup is imported and interpreted wrongly",,alka.kshirsagar2@vodafone.com,ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com,atharva.paskanthi@vodafone.com,gaurav.lanjewar1@vodafone.com,gokul.vade@vodafone.com,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,OAF-762,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"02/May/24 12:50 PM;stephanie.krammer@vodafone.com;OSF Incident Ticket - CRImprovement notwendig - OS-54646 OSF  ACC1  Wave 8.2  sliding prices are not interpreted as expected - Vodafone Global Jira.msg;https://jira.sp.vodafone.com/secure/attachment/1281954/OSF+Incident+Ticket+-+CRImprovement+notwendig+-+OS-54646+OSF++ACC1++Wave+8.2++sliding+prices+are+not+interpreted+as+expected+-+Vodafone+Global+Jira.msg","10/Apr/24 9:33 PM;stephanie.krammer@vodafone.com;image-2024-04-09-15-34-39-869.png;https://jira.sp.vodafone.com/secure/attachment/1267853/image-2024-04-09-15-34-39-869.png","10/Apr/24 9:34 PM;stephanie.krammer@vodafone.com;image-2024-04-09-15-42-29-039.png;https://jira.sp.vodafone.com/secure/attachment/1267854/image-2024-04-09-15-42-29-039.png","10/Apr/24 9:30 PM;stephanie.krammer@vodafone.com;image-2024-04-10-18-00-56-136.png;https://jira.sp.vodafone.com/secure/attachment/1267849/image-2024-04-10-18-00-56-136.png","11/Apr/24 12:55 PM;stephanie.krammer@vodafone.com;pcat-without-fix.tar.xz;https://jira.sp.vodafone.com/secure/attachment/1268028/pcat-without-fix.tar.xz","10/Apr/24 9:32 PM;stephanie.krammer@vodafone.com;screenshot-1.png;https://jira.sp.vodafone.com/secure/attachment/1267851/screenshot-1.png",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,The issue is a show stopper for the Go Live of Young Promotion feature which is planned for April Main Release 29.04,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,OS-49399,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"v9.18.5-BB1 2024-04-02 06:59 |04-09|21-54",Fixed with CR826 in Wave 9.2 release ,,Cable,,Omnius,ACC,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Green,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"0|i9j9qv:",9223372036854775807,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Backlog - UNCOVERED,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Code,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,TechM -> PCAT,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"11/Apr/24 11:55 AM;ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com;[~vikash.saurav@vodafone.com]  [~bharath.krishnamurthy@vodafone.com]  please check this on priority, if you need a call to discuss the details we can organize it but we need to be fast.

there was a request to OGW to remove logs from catalina.out and only show warning logs (Z_INC02740606A).



so some of the logs in OGW will not be completed after this implementation. 

for push order status i added a log for it in the env. i will commit it and it will be available from next delivery.;;;","08/Apr/24 4:51 PM;ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com;Remark: For ACC its not useful to remove the logs from initial store place, so the INC Change was only relevant for PROD.

Hi [~akash.ubbu@vodafone.com] ,

If the statuses for old orders are not updated, it probably means that the messages are no longer there in the queue, and they will not come now. I don’t have access to ACC, so can’t check it by myself.

- The troubleshooting was done and logs were checked by TID for Status of old orders, but it seems complicated to investigate old orders.

- The issue may have been caused due to environment on 26th March.

I supposed that this log file was found in the i10 Archive folder.

I have attached i11 logs of that order.

for daemons log last time we checked on call there was no logs available for 26th march, but let me check once again if logs are available then i will attach it.;;;","05/Apr/24 2:04 PM;ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com;[~vikash.saurav@vodafone.com]  it was especially for orders from 26.03 where we have this status mismatch and also the logs were missing on this day ;;;","05/Apr/24 3:53 PM;vikash.saurav@vodafone.com;Irina added a comment -
[~akash.ubbu@vodafone.com] 
 

So, we have i11 logs for status updates at both the order and the package levels. Files were created at the same time. We can say that the status update files have been sent to RabbitMQ. Daemons consume status update messages after OIL send them to RMQ. Based on the FE, we can say that the package level was successfully consumed and processed. To make any inference about the order status update, we need to analyze the daemon logs.
As I asked, please provide the appropriate Demon logs starting from 03/26/2024.;;;","08/Apr/24 12:27 PM;akash.ubbu@vodafone.com;Hi [~vikash.saurav@vodafone.com] ,

With further investigation we (again) found that the databases already have a very bad performance. This is now under investigation by DBA team.

ACC2 will be branch 9.0, delivery is on 28.03.

ACC3 is for TechM part 8.2.1 branch, for Amdocs we can take the delivery 8.2 from ACC1, but we can only deploy the same to ACC3 when the delivery went live to PROD.

We have opened a TTWOS ticket to OSF ACC1 team (Z_PRT00138230A);;;","06/Mar/24 12:55 PM;gaurav.lanjewar1@vodafone.com;Hi [~bharath.krishnamurthy@vodafone.com]  Do we have any update from Waseem. Can you please share latest status

 

FYI

[~vikash.saurav@vodafone.com] ;;;","08/Mar/24 8:42 PM;waseem.akhtar@vodafone.com;RCA:

# Unklnown  “agent_role_UPPER_CASE_ROLEKEY” present.
# Additional Foreign key “agent_ibfk_1” was present on “agent” table linking agent.role_id to agent_role_UPPER_CASE_ROLEKEY.role_id
# This additional foreign key was causing integrity violation when adding permission to agent and failing with 500.

Analysis steps:

# Double checked to confirm this additional table and foreign key ONLY present on ACC1.
# Renamed the table to a different name
# Run resetModules.php
# clear cache
# Check if all modules are updated to latest version. This ensures all application database upgrade scripts are run.
# Table was not created after this on ACC1.
# This confirms the table was NOT created by application.

Resolution steps:

# Delete the Foreign key “agent_ibfk_1” present on “agent” table linking agent.role_id to agent_role_UPPER_CASE_ROLEKEY.role_id
# Unfortunately this deletes a needed foreign key with same name linking agent.role_id to agent_role.role_id
# recreate the Foreign key “agent_ibfk_1” on “agent” table linking agent.role_id to agent_role.role_id



[~taher.golvala@vodafone.com] [~ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com] Issue resolved. Please note this is NOT an application issue. IF possible try to find out who created this table on ACC1.

Initial mentioned problem was related to add roles to user, so maybe this is different error now- Waseem is checking with Sneha;;;","13/Mar/24 6:30 PM;ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com;We have corrected the problem with adding a role but for the problem to remove a role we need to correct something in Omnius Backoffice

_UPDATE agent_role set role_key = 'COPS_UNITY_TEAMLEITER' where role_key = 'COPS_Unity_Teamleiter';_

Shared via Email to TID team;;;","14/Mar/24 1:32 PM;atharva.paskanthi@vodafone.com;Ari added a comment : 

We had some problems by processing NGUM request to ACC1 to remove this role and then we identified some gaps.

 

[@Lokesh Dohare, Vodafone|mailto:lokesh.dohare@vodafone.com] can you check with the setting mentioned below for ACC1 and ACC2 again?

 ;;;","15/Mar/24 1:36 PM;lokesh.dohare@vodafone.com;After discussion with Waseem on 13th March, we came to conclusion that we need to update role_key = 'COPS_UNITY_TEAMLEITER' for the role = 'COPS_Unity_Teamleiter'.

But according to Anja Durben, for ACC1 the role key must be COPS_Unity_Teamleiter. And for ACC2, it must be COPS_UNITY_TEAMLEITER. 

Currently, we have updated the roles, as suggested by Anja for both ACC1 and ACC2 env.

So, the same has to be discussed with Waseem. ;;;","15/Mar/24 3:04 PM;ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com;We received the confirmation that now also the ""remove"" and ""disable"" task for ACC1 went fine

!image-2024-03-15-10-33-40-947.png!

 

So in the end we have done two fixes:
 * one for ""add role to user"" (remove the unexpected table setting)
 *  one for ""remove role from user / Disable user"" related to COPS_Unity_Teamleiter

We are just reviewing it once with Waseem, and then we can close the defect ;;;","15/Mar/24 8:22 PM;ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com;Checked with Waseem, we can accept current solution (although the difference in the spelling on the environments might be confusing in the future again);;;",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Hi all,

that matches the symptoms: VFP timeout is around 11 seconds, and IT VFP actually often takes longer to get a result.

My recommendation would be to increase AsbCheck.ws.timeout to something between 20000 and 30000.

yes, currently the fix is almost ready after discussions with design team and Ketaki.

in this fix the 24 retry will not be in use anymore, instead the retry will be determined by the ogw_error_handler table.

it will decide how many times to retry, and how much time to wait between the calls.

for this flow the retry will be active for empty response from oneDMS or OGWERR-9900 error code return

for example:
this is a record from the table:

{
    ""ERROR_CODE"":""OGWERR-9900"",
    ""ERROR_CATEGORY"":""Technical"",
    ""IGNORE_ERROR_IND"":""N"",
    ""RETRYABLE_IND"":""TRUE"",
    ""MAX_RETRY_TIMES"":""3"",
    ""RETRY_WAIT_TIME"":""10"",
    ""MAX_WAIT_TIME"":null,
    ""STATUS_TO_SET"":null,
    ""CHANNEL"":""TELESALES"",
    ""SERVICE_CALL"":""ASYNC"",
    ""SERVICE_NAME"":""OneDMS""
}
so the flow will retry 3 times and the wait time will be 10 seconds between every try.;;;","16/May/24 4:05 PM;ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com;informed [~kirill.leibov1@vodafone.com]  to get in touch with Ran to discuss if the solution is ok from vodafone side;;;","17/May/24 1:34 PM;kirill.leibov1@vodafone.com;The existing solution with 24 tries must be {+}not removed{+}, but it shall remain as the +default+ behavior in the case, that we do not have no configuration in the ogw_error_handler table.;;;","19/May/24 1:34 PM;ran.farjun1@vodafone.com;thanks Kiril,

There is a change in SAP Z42 environment where they have changed the DeliveryServiceId ""GLSSTDFCA"" to ""DHLSTDFCA"" where as of now in OGW Drools logic this value is not available.
So OGW needs to add this DeliveryServiceid value in Drools to accept the response from SAP and sent to Omnius.

Why do u expect them to not be displayed?;;;","29/Feb/24 2:02 PM;ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com;[~netta.erez@vodafone.com]  the problem is, that these orders which are creating the tickets are placed in OSF already weeks ago.

seems like Cable is sending Set order status every half hour for this OGW order id: 1767470.

that's way it coming up even if its an older order request

and seems for some of the request that was sent we get errors like this:

seems we are getting set order status from cable several times a day the same order status: InProgress-FulfillmentStarted.

its starting from FEB 13 until March.



so if OGW encounter an error while processing this set order status request, even if its 20 days after the initial submit order request, the ticket for it will open.

[~simon.auch@vodafone.com]  FYI - we get unexpected status response from VKD for old orders all the time, especially at night ;;;","03/Apr/24 5:05 PM;simon.auch@vodafone.com;The system on VKD site does not remember the full details of the last status update sent to OSF. In addition many state system on VKD side contains much more states than the few reported to OSF. For some of these state transitions if the source and target state both map to the same OSF state it would not surprise me that OSF gets ""duplicated"" status updates. These however are not incorrect since the order is in the state reproted.

I'm not familiar enough with the requirments for which these systems where implemented, but I would assume (especially since it behaves this way for years now) that it is to be expected that OSF might get the same update multiple times for orders.

Why these especially happen at night: maybe a side effect of some bulk jobs on VKD side.;;;","05/Apr/24 12:43 PM;atharva.paskanthi@vodafone.com;Hello [~eugen.berdyansky@vodafone.com] , [~rohan.kumbhar@vodafone.com] can you please provide your inputs;;;","05/Apr/24 2:25 PM;eugen.berdyansky@vodafone.com;[~atharva.paskanthi@vodafone.com]  the cable process of setOrderStatus worked in general [9:00 -16:00 normal working time], and hier we have some logical problem beetween SKY App. and another Stack.

Based on the logs you provided, we identified that there is something wrong in the positioning of functions in the input som provided to FIF. 

Because of that reason your order got stuck and this is not in scope of FIF. FIF is working as designed.

As per latest comments from Ran , Issue is between COM and FIF , Could you please check and suggest here.;;;","29/Feb/24 7:44 PM;marco.abraham01@vodafone.com;Yes, the issue occurs between COM and FIF but the root cause is an incorrect sorting in the xml structure.

{*}DXC Feedback{*}: One remark this sequence of functions is defined by COM in SOM XSD. It’s nothing internally invented. TrxBld/FIF expects the orders follow the SOM XSD. Of course we don’t validate incoming orders otherwise not all types would work. However we validate the order that are SOM Editor and FIF originalted

*Additional information:*
Indeed it is a bug related to the order of the functions only. I extracted and uploaded manually OSF orders without further modification to get SOM-XSD function order and it works. KBA does not cause that issue because they send the orders in SOM-XSD order as expected.

Steps to reproduce for Telesales channel:

1) Enter unitymedia or VKD adress -> new customer
2) Add KUD product e.g. GigaTV Net, 1.{-}6. Monat 0,{-}€
3) move to checkout, fill in customer details > customer adress in Germany
4) reach to IBAN section, type in GERMAN IBAN e.g. DE20700500000003658888 (Any German IBAN can be taken!)
->IBAN validation is running and successfull
5) Select invoice adress as customer adress and do NOT select any different bank account holder
6) Klick on ""weiter"" and get error message

_{color:#ff0000}Die ausgewählten kabel-unabhängigen Produkte (z.B. GigaTV App und Net) lassen seit dem 01.04.2018 eine Nutzung innerhalb der gesamten EU zu. Aber nach gesetzlichen Vorgaben nur von Kunden mit festem Wohnsitz in Deutschland.){color}_

_{color:#ff0000}Die Prüfung der Bankverbindung hat ergeben, dass eine ausländische Bankverbindung oder ein abweichender Kontoinhaber angegeben wurden.{color}_

_{color:#ff0000}Leider kann aus diesen Gründen die Prüfung auf festen Wohnsitz in Deutschland nur über den nächsten Vodafone-Shop erfolgen. Bringen Sie hierzu Ihren Personalausweis oder eine Meldebescheinigung mit.{color}_

 

We are not using foreign customer adress or foreign IBAN, and also +*not*+ using foreign invoice adress or different bank account holder
It is not the problem, that its going to be validated if there is any data from foreign countries used! The validation itself is correct process - but the result is wrong! It has to be identified by the system, that this customer is allowed to pay the products so we are able to move to the next section.

 

It seems the booking works sometimes, and sometimes not. Or maybe only for specific constellation of KUD products it works. We need to investigate if there is an issue with the software or not

Hi [~natasa.dimovic1@vodafone.com]  [~ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com] ,

We have analyzed further and found that there is recent requirement over (https://jira.sp.vodafone.com/browse/OAF-690) [!https://bmcomviva.atlassian.net/images/icons/issuetypes/epic.svg!VFDED1FTS-5531: CR780 - Change of payment validation check for existing SEPA mandatIN DESIGN|https://bmcomviva.atlassian.net/browse/VFDED1FTS-5531] which is now available as part of the software where we are testing the above scenario.

As part the requirement we are now showing NOTIFICATION MODAL and disable ""Weiter"" button of payment section if the scenario we are performing meets below conditions.

System will validate if payment method = ""direct debit""
 * if yes: system will validate if IBAN = DE-IBAN

 ** if yes: system will validate if bank account owner (payer contact) = legal contact

 *** if yes: the system will validate if the bank account owner address (payer address) = legal address

 **** if no: SHOW NOTIFICATION MODAL and disable ""Weiter"" button

-> Its payer adress = legal adress

ALL are YES -> so no window should be shown.

So you are not getting some of the information back from PCAT side? This Contact is missing? Or what is missing value?

Hi Ari,
 

As per the CR780 we are checking below conditions

Technically we have only these additional validation
 * KUD(Cable Independent package with product in category CABLE->giga_app_de) in cart

 * Its valid DE IBAN

 * Its bank account owner = legal contact

 * Its payer address = legal address

If all conditions meet then agent is allowed to continue.

 
*Customer legal contact & legal address* is what we capture or prefill on customer section of checkout

!b117ed88-4bda-47a3-8750-9f38f445a52f.png!

*Bank account owner (payer contact) & Bank account owner address (payer address)* is what we receive as part of *GetPayerAndPaymentInfoResponse* which is {{I1004_GetPayerAndPaymentInfo}} service response we are expected to receive for Cable packages in addition to {{I04_ConvertAndValidateIBAN}} *.*

*!468b5eec-eef3-4ba2-9939-4efeb1a62c8b.png!*

*Here in this scenario one of the condition is getting failed based on the check mentioned on CR780*
 * Its bank account owner = legal contact

 * Its payer address = legal address;;;","27/Feb/24 6:17 PM;ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com;[~vikash.saurav@vodafone.com] I think there is some logical error in the scenario.

1) if the IBAN is already existing in cable backend, it might be possible to give back information about the payer (CR780)

2) if its NEW IBAN, like here - how should cable backend know something about this payer? Its not existing in backend yet, will just be created with this new order - so the response has to be with empty data;;;","01/Mar/24 12:53 PM;gaurav.lanjewar1@vodafone.com;Hi [~bharath.krishnamurthy@vodafone.com]  Do we have any update on this.

Hi Ari,

After Yesterday call on  4-3-2024, with VF team and BA Thorsten

Conclusion of the call: user story improvement will be created by BA Kshitij.;;;","05/Mar/24 2:29 PM;ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com;We have discussed yesterday with Kshitij -> the actual requirement of CR780 was to compare data in the checkout itself, and not use any data from the cable backend for it. This was not concrete enough described in the requirement itself. 

When calling cable backend for unknown IBANS it cannot give any data back, and therefore the flow is blocked, as data entered in frontend is not matching to data coming back from cable backend (as its empty).

Improvement is required to change the flow - until this time the defect has to be on hold. As its blocking KUD only flow completely, it has to be changed as fast as possible (its present in production already as well)

rollback of CR780 is not possible ;;;","14/Mar/24 5:33 PM;ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com;[~vikash.saurav@vodafone.com]  is there any update on the improvement story we have discussed about in the call with Kshitij and [~thorsten.lehnert@vodafone.com] ?;;;","18/Mar/24 12:19 PM;gaurav.lanjewar1@vodafone.com;Hi [~vikash.saurav@vodafone.com]  is kshitij available today?  Can you ask him to share his input.;;;","20/Mar/24 7:33 PM;gaurav.lanjewar1@vodafone.com;Update from Kshitij :

Hi [~natasa.dimovic1@vodafone.com]  ,

I can see for customer you mentioned the PermissionValue is not proper the expected values from Mode 3 response are “Y“ “N“.

If PermissionValue is “Y“ & BEWVersionNumber is equal then BEW is not allowed .

If BEWVersionNumber is greater than stored BEW version number then BEW is not allowed.

In telesales if PermissionID is ADV & Voice log permission not assigned then BEW is not allowed.

 

This is older logic and no changes happened in code. It all depends on Mode 3 response , Stored BEW configuration data & voice permission(In telesales)

Thanks;;;","19/Feb/24 5:47 PM;natasa.dimovic1@vodafone.com;Hi [~ajay.bhavar@vodafone.com] the last time you could also help with the defect: https://jira.sp.vodafone.com/browse/OS-41098 .

"OSF | Wave 8.2 | ACC1 | OS-199 | EL discount Summary text and EL discount footnote is missing from contract summary and contract document in Prolongation (VVL) without tariff change scenario",OS-51959,3158992,Bug,Closed,OS,"OSF wave4, wave 5 ..",software,matthias.breuer1@vodafone.com,,,2-Critical,Fixed,nasir.sayyad@vodafone.com,nasir.sayyad@vodafone.com,nasir.sayyad@vodafone.com,13/Feb/24 4:02 PM,16/Feb/24 2:15 PM,07/Oct/25 1:12 PM,16/Feb/24 2:12 PM,,Wave 8.2,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Hello,

While performing prolongation without tariff change scenario we have observed summary text related to EL discount on contract summary and footnote related to EL discount on contract document is missing.

*Reference story*: OS-36804, OS-5502

Summary text related to EL discount on contract summary should be printed as below:

""Der Mitarbeiter-Rabatt gilt nur wenn und solange ein Nachweis der Zugehörigkeit zum berechtigten Unternehmen vorliegt. Fehlt oder entfällt diese Voraussetzung, gelten ausschließlich die Standardpreise ohne Mitarbeiter-Rabatte.""

Footnote  text related to EL discount on contract document should be printed as below

The following footnote #20 shall be printed on the contract: {}Für die Gewährung des Mitarbeiter-Rabatts ist die Vorlage eines gültigen Mitarbeiterausweises, eines Einkommensnachweises der beschäftigenden Firma oder aber ein schriftlicher Nachweis der ,Unternehmenszugehörigkeit erforderlich, der die Zugehörigkeit des für den Rabatt zugelassenen Unternehmens dokumentiert. Liegt innerhalb von 4 Wochen keine Bestätigung vor, gelten nach Ablauf dieser Frist ohne weitere Ankündigung ausschließlich die in der Standard-Preisliste dargestellten Preise ohne die gewährten Mitarbeiter-
Rabatte. Sollte die nachträgliche Prüfung der Mitarbeiter-Legitimation aufgrund der Unternehmenszugehörigkeit eine Zugehörigkeit zu einer anderen Rabattklasse aufzeigen, passen wir den Rabatt auf das für Ihr Unternehmen freigegebene Niveau an. Der Mitarbeiter-Rabatt ist begrenzt auf maximal 4 Karten pro Mitarbeiter. Sollten darüber hinaus Verträge abgeschlossen werden, behalten wir uns vor, den Rabatt bei den überzähligen Karten zu entfernen.Bekommen Sie als Mitarbeiter eines Partner-Unternehmens schon einen Mitarbeiter-Rabatt auf Ihre Mobilfunk-Rechnung und buchen Sie die GigaKombi, erhalten Sie keine GigaKombi-Gutschrift. Alle weiteren GigaKombi-Vorteile bleiben für Sie bestehen.

*Steps to reproduce*:

1. Login to retail portal with PA Agent.
2. Search a Customer (Eligible for VVL)
3. click on Hamburger menu and select an option to search company
4. Verify company search tab is visible(Select tab)
5. Select a Company.
6. Company id and discount level will be stored in session
7. Perform VVL without tariff change
8. Verify based on the selected Company(ID) OSF product configurator should be automatically filter on available products
9. Verify the EL discount level (High or Low), should be available and after selecting it should be added to the shopping cart, when the agent selected the Company ID and desired product
10. Verify Based on the discount level (as a result of the company search) either EL_HIGH or EL_LOW should displayed in the Discounts section of the configurator
11. Verify Discount should be added to the shopping cart and  price should be calculated and shown correctly (in shopping cart and extended shopping cart) based on tariff and discount level
12. fill necesary details.
13. Click on Drucken button to generate contract summary
14. submit order

*Actual Result:* Summary text and footnote text is not getting printed on contract summary and contract document

Hi [~suraj.bhor@vodafone.com] 

In ST it was tested for multi stack and for SI with cable, dsl & mobile ban we are not sending Subscriptions node itself.

can you please  confirm if we deployed the patch on all webservers that ACC1 env is deployed/set on.

[~alka.kshirsagar2@vodafone.com] [~gaurav.lanjewar1@vodafone.com] please arrange call and check further

 
 
 ;;;","20/Feb/24 4:42 PM;ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com;As far as I understood, the issue is happening for all scenarios which Mobile customers having more than the subscriber threshold value, which is configured in OGW: <MAX_SUBSCRIBERS_OMNIUS_360>{*}{color:#FF0000}xx{color}{*}</MAX_SUBSCRIBERS_OMNIUS_360>

In production this value will be {*}{color:#FF0000}25{color}{*}, so it would happen in case having Mobile customers with more than 25 subscribers. Then no NBA tips are visible, but order processing would be possible.

If we have Mobile customers with less subscribers, it should work as today.

i can see its an authentication error when calling this api:

;;;","13/Feb/24 1:12 PM;ran.farjun1@vodafone.com;is the issue over?
i know there was a deployment yesterday, was the test after the deployment?

the last change from OGW for this flow was on Jan 25.;;;","13/Feb/24 2:46 PM;ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com;At the moment I assume, the E2E ILS Flow is not working because of changes for composite order we have implemented end of January on ACC. This was required because of changes on Solstice backend side. 
The changes which are needed on OSF side, to make ILS Flow work again, are currently planned for wave 9.1 [OS-34912] Shift creation of composite order from OSE to Template Engine in ILS context - Vodafone Global Jira

However, I am not 100% sure if this error is related to this missing change or something different, therefore we need to check the ticket once again [~daniel.loos@vodafone.com] is back ;;;","21/Feb/24 1:35 PM;ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com;We need to check if this error is caused by some wrong configuration after Composite Order changes/ APIGEE changes.

actually this defect requires existing customers for which we were getting an error. I have discussed that with Daniel, he said he'll check with SIT once.

we dont have any Solstice products deployed on our system, so we need to wait until the catalog is updated

This will take a while because we also need a new parser delivery. So it actually cannot work right now

I'll update as soon as I got news regarding the new parser

without Solstice products we cannot load any customer due to inventory check.;;;","15/Mar/24 3:28 PM;tanvi.bagade@vodafone.com;Hi [~arndt.vorrath@vodafone.com], I have retested the flow but same error observed :

OGW need to check the Postpaid_handler_flow_v22 and see why this request is getting triggered numerous time and also why so many SKY tickets are generated.

To be checked if the issue is related to OS-50890;;;","10/Feb/24 11:25 PM;ran.farjun1@vodafone.com;yes Rohan that's correct but there is more issues in this defect.

currently in this build we have an error in the retry mechanism, so when OGW facing an error its getting stuck in the same status and not even create sky ticket.

for example you can check these orders:

792259 :1748619
791471 :1747529
791585 :1747698

what you mention is a specific case for this flow only:
vfde_postpaid_order_handler_flow_V22

in this flow the retry mechanism is working but its doing an infinite loop and it will open a ticket every few min.

you can see it for these requests (OGW_ORDERID):

1727539
1727536
1727593

first issue we have a fix. but its need to be deliver in full delivery and not as patch.

second issue, i stop vfde_postpaid_order_handler_flow_V22 in bot WF servers, so currently this issue is not recurring so it will not interfere with other testing, and this issue will also be fix in the next full delivery.

While performing OS-199 scenario in retail channel, we have observed twice discount (SOC) name is being shown in shopping cart and  Extended shopping cart.

*Note:* we assume that the EL_dummy_SOC is probably still there and visible. And also actual price calculation in the “Gutschriften und Aktionen Section” instead of 0,00€ as well as for the shopping cart view.

*Steps to re-produce:*
1. Login to retail portal with FI Agent.
2. click on Hamburger menu and select an option to search company
3. Verify company search tab is visible(Select tab)
4. Select a Company.
5. Company id and discount level will be stored in session.
6. Go to configurator.
7. Check if Discount product available.
8. Select Mobile package and chose EL package
9. Verify based on the selected Company(ID) OSF product configurator should be automatically filter on available products
10. Discount name should be shown once in the shopping cart and extended shopping cart

*Actual Result:*  Twice discount name is being shown in shopping cart and  Extended shopping cart

*Expected Result*: Discount name should be shown once in the shopping cart and extended shopping cart

Steps to Reproduce:

2) perform ILS on  DSL
3) change product and move to extended shopping cart
4) Move till Billing Address section and validate in inspect element window

 

Actual Result:  

Validate Call is done.

In the Billing section the *invalid* billing address('{*}Schreibfehler{*}') is pre-filled and grayed out.

Agent is able to proceed further and place the order with the incorrect billing address when clicking on ‘Weiter’.

 

Expected Result:

Validate Call is done.

If Street name is not valid, a red banner should be shown 'pls correct the address'.

The Agent should not be allowed to continue with the sales flow bevor he corrected it.

A dropdown option should be displayed to add the correct billing address ‘Abweichende Rechnungsadresse'.

Thank you;;;","07/Feb/24 4:40 PM;natasa.dimovic1@vodafone.com;Hi [~vikash.saurav@vodafone.com] the customer 934800577 is a VKD KUD customer, but on a Unity Media address. This seems to be the issue

This is the answer from Raniero:

You need to check with OSF, this is what OSF is sending:
and OSF is sending a request for an UM customer (BW = Baden Württenberg).

This is a urn for a VKD customer:

!image-2024-02-07-12-08-44-486.png!

This is a urn for a UM customer:

!image-2024-02-07-12-09-00-539.png!

In SoapUI you are sending a request for a VKD customer, OSF sends a request for an UM customer.

Could you please check that again? Thanks;;;","07/Feb/24 5:33 PM;vikash.saurav@vodafone.com;Divya Kumbla added a comment -
 
 
Hi [~natasa.dimovic1@vodafone.com]  ,Again the decision of whether the customer is VKD or UM is based on AccountCategory in getCustomerResult for index search

and Region in retrieveCustomerInfo mode1 for Legacysearch.

For reference

!image-2024-02-07-17-32-45-292.png!

So we need to check what is coming for this customer for which you need to share the search response and mode1 response logs.;;;","07/Feb/24 6:06 PM;natasa.dimovic1@vodafone.com;Hi [~vikash.saurav@vodafone.com] please find attached the logs;;;","08/Feb/24 1:12 PM;vikash.saurav@vodafone.com;Divya Kumbla added a comment -
 
Hi [~natasa.dimovic1@vodafone.com] 

As said earlier the region from mode1 decides if its VKD or UM, and as per attached logs we receive region as UME-KBW hence OSE considers it as UM customer.

 * Values like ""AccountCategory"" in Omnius are derived from OGW: Here:- _AccountCategory_ in getCustomerResult for index search and _Region_ in retrieveCustomerInfo mode1 for LegacySearch.
 * As the ADDRESS REGION is in UM Area - it is treated as UM customer, even though he belongs to the VKD Stack

h4. _Possible SD option to be validated/proven:_ 
 * Derive customer stack from GlobalID prefix (""legacy stack"")  instead of address region
 * IF improvements required as this is only known by OGW (Omnius can only see LK_ from linked customers) - e.g. introducing new attribute to indicate customers product stack:
 * CustomerSearch()
 * getCustomerDetails()
 * [@Mitra, Gaurab, External Vendor|mailto:gaurab.mitra@amdocs.com]: We should investigate if further interfaces have to be considered (To be discussed on next CR meeting)

[@Kshitij.Srivastava@comviva.com|mailto:kshitij.srivastava@comviva.com]: To check UseCases in Omnius to be considered for an improvement

Further benefit: Omnius Performance increase If product stack information is directly provided by OGW

3) change product and move to extended shopping cart
4) Move till Billing Address section and validate in inspect element window

Checked with Developer @Balaji Ragothaman 
This is not related to CR710, it is already in the code and this Validated tag is trigger based on outcome of validate address client.
It is part of handling in code level, nothing related to functionality differences.

[~taher.golvala@vodafone.com]  please check ;;;","01/Feb/24 1:15 PM;taher.golvala@vodafone.com;As discussed yesterday its not understandable how we getting the Validated status in some scenarios (i.e. whichever flows we concluded in past) and later in few scenarios where this is not giving the validated status in inspect element.
Also if this case is expected then we need to understand that why in some cases its coming validated and some of them not giving Validated status.

Also if its not related to CR710 we never verified this before in order to compare something in past and present what changes been applied.

So it will be good if we we get the explanation in what cases we get Validated and in what cases we can ignore. ;;;","06/Feb/24 11:39 AM;vikash.saurav@vodafone.com;Balaji Ragothaman added a comment 
 
Its not related to CR710 based on our analysis. Also its not a defect as its not affecting anything in functionality. in coding level need to understand what implemented in past . 

 

Developer is investigating this issue.

Hi [~taher.golvala@vodafone.com] 

 

Type value on the xhr request header specifies the type of the address we are validating via the xhr and it is purely for the technical purpose (development purpose to communicate between front end and backend logic before triggering validate service to actual backend). The OSE backend logic will be different which works based on values we send accordingly.

 this is not defect, it purely technical handling, not directly involved in triggering validate address service.

[~alka.kshirsagar2@vodafone.com] fyi;;;","09/Feb/24 12:34 PM;taher.golvala@vodafone.com;As per the yesterday's discussion with Balaji SunilKumar and vikash from Tech M team. It was mentioned that this is nothing but related to Technical checks and not from testing perspective which we were checking in inspect element mode.
Hence considering that point we can close the defect with no impact on test or respective flow.

Hallo Joachim,

 

I wanted to get back to you briefly on the subject of ""ReadyAPI"".

 

In the meantime, I have now got the tool installed on my VDI and can perform the tests on my own. In general, there seems to be no problem with the connectivity to the license server, I can reach the server via web browser asl as well as via curl-command if a proxy is configured in the Windows system settings. However, the ReadyAPI tool doesn't seem to be using this system proxy, and even when manually configuring the proxy in the login screen, the connection doesn't work.

Maybe the Windows firewall on the VDI is also preventing the connection, I'm going to create a ticket today to check the firewall settings.

I'll get back to you as soon as I have any news...;;;","16/May/24 8:52 PM;ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com;[~gauri.bhagat@vodafone.com]  any update here?;;;","17/May/24 12:31 PM;gokul.vade@vodafone.com;Hi [~ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com] 

--Latest Update *Gesendet:* Dienstag, 7. Mai 2024 15:44

Hallo Joachim,

 

sorry, ich hatte mich lange nicht mehr bei Dir mit einem Status-Update gemeldet ☹

 

Anscheinend ignoriert ReadyAPI jede Proxy-Einstellung (egal ob direkt im Tool oder indirekt über das Windows-System), daher habe wir Anfang letzter Woche einen Firewall-Request (OOT-1506) für eine Direktverbindung in Auftrag gegeben mit folgenden Daten:

i got the payload from OM, i can see that *DOC_TYPE = O:* <ns3:externeId>1730823||{*}O{*}|Mobile_Postpaid</ns3:externeId>.

in that case OGW will not store the documents in ACMS until GET_SIGNED_DOCUMENT api will get invoke.

i check the DB and i didnt saw for this ogwOrderID any record in JESI for this event.

i use this query:

select * from JESI_WF_AMDOCS_SUBSCRIBE where message_name = 'GET_SIGNED_DOCUMENT' and ctcr_sys_cre_dt > sysdate - 10

after that i got 1 result, but for a different OGWorderId: 1734666

you can check like so:
select CDM_TXID from OGW_SEARCH_CRITERIA WHERE WEB_ID_TRANSACTION_ID=$(WEB_ID_TRANSACTION_ID)
WEB_ID_TRANSACTION_ID that i found was: 0001b82e-864b-4d4a-bb7c-333493729edc1705931352671

The confirmed customer signature is missing here. If the value is ""O"", the signature is obtained online. The document is then saved in ACMS. Pares now wants to archive, but doesn't get the document because it hasn't been saved yet. But Pares would only do this if all order lines have been completed. It looks like something went wrong with OnlineIdent? -> to clarify with WebID (perhaps environmental problem)

 

is the document signed?

Hi [~ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com]  ,

I don't see the steps to reproduce and if its for existing customer we need mode logs and serviceability logs between OSE<->OIL & OIL<->OGW.

Thanks

[~alka.kshirsagar2@vodafone.com] fyi;;;","24/Jan/24 3:56 PM;ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com;[~vikash.saurav@vodafone.com]  I was not creating any order, I am just scanning portal UI tool from time to time to find unidentified issues. And within this quality check I have found tickets with this error message. 

 

After some analysis I have identified, that it seems to be this scenario:

-> Search existing unitymedia customer and perform Move to VKD adress 

 

this is example Order ID from ACC1 - it failed with 2 sky tickets

One ticket because of invalid VPKN (issue is solved, please ignore that) and second sky ticket was for setpermission.


Unfortunately Sky ticket were cleared in between so I am not able to find my two tickets anymore..... But hopefully you can reproduce on your environment for a Move from Unity to VKD.

Seems like in this case the existing customer ID from unity is taken over, instead of recognizing that customer will get a new customer ID from VKD for Move scenario

 

Order ID 782545, Customer ID 1009755201 (initial customer before Move) 

!image-2024-01-24-11-21-17-927.png!

 

Same seems to happen when moving from Unity Cable to DSL product. 

So please check flow Unity Cable to VKD Cable Move, and Unity Cable to DSL Move

 ;;;","25/Jan/24 5:24 PM;ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com;We have placed another order yesterday.

*Move from Unity Cable to VKD Cable* with permission selection in checkout.
Omnius Order ID 783467

 

In SetPermission Call I see that its called for Cable - {*}UN{*}, but the target customer is VKD Customer after Move. 



So I would expect in the setpermission call that system is calling VKD with new VKD customer ID, right? It does not make sense to store a permission in unitymedia backend when the customer is going to be inactive there, and will be active only in VKD in the future with new customer ID

Hi [~ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com]  ,

Further based on investigation above is the expected behavior. Which means for the existing customer we are getting the region value from Install Base and if region value which is from the IB or from the serviceability(in ACQ) is not matching with the below table data which is agreed during the design, then OSE send empty <CustomerList><CustomerDetails>{*}<TargetSystem>{*}.

If for any new region value VF expects to send *TargetSystem* value then it has to be added to OSE via SRT

We can change ACC1 to have more resources.

Currently for memory arguments for example it has 2048m while prod has 5g

Also jms executor and dispatcher count is very low for ACC – 3 for both while prod has 10 dispatcher and 50 executors.

Same for number of DB connections.

We can start with increasing dispatcher and executor count and memory arguments.

As i understood from Vishank the changes need to be aligned with testing team.

The particular endpoint used by OSF however does not allow passing the crm explicitly, so for the sake of getting the v2/v3 switch I will see if I can port the workaround from v2 to v3.

We might want to then later revisit if the crm parameter can also be passed explicitly by osf.

PR with the workaround: [Pull Request #5895: OS-50918: determine crm based on address. - webgit (kabeldeutschland.de)|https://webgit.kabeldeutschland.de/projects/FE/repos/ibp/pull-requests/5895/overview];;;","22/Jan/24 4:51 PM;gaurav.lanjewar1@vodafone.com;Hi [~simon.auch@vodafone.com]  do you have any latest update on this defect?

Hi [~suraj.bhor@vodafone.com] 

 

Refer https://jira.sp.vodafone.com/browse/OS-38713. It has all details which are data nodes required to show subscriptions on popup or *Handling of (Mobile) customers with >25 subscribers* functionality to work proper.

Below are the two details we get from Mode 1 response
 # ns0:RetrieveCustomerInfoResponse/ns0:Customer/dlc:Contract/dlc:Subscription/dlc:Ctn/.

 # SubscribersCount.

If we don't have data on dlc:Subscription/dlc:Ctn which means OSE not received any subscriptions data to process further and it can lead to above errors.

The corresponding SOC has ~140 discount plans in KIAS. An the addition of the word “dann” would imply the manual change of ~140 description records. Moreover, the current refdata setup is already productive in KIAS since 2021 without any complaint so far.

i check the same request and i do get results in WF.

i notice that in your case ogworderId was different in the response from OGW:

in generate contract you got in the response:  <OGWOrderID>1731169</OGWOrderID>

and in Fulfillment you got: <OGWOrderID>1731170</OGWOrderID>.

when i check this OGWOrdwerId (1731170) in wf i do see result.

update jesi_wf_sub_executer set message_status='C' where message_name ='Callback@vfde/order/kias/postpaid/handler/vfde_postpaid_order_handler_flow_V21.xml'; 
 
Also deleted stuck online ident orders from December month with following query.
 
elete ogw_auxiliary_stuck_order where order_line_status like '%Online%' and status_update_time_stamp like '%-DEC-23%';

Changed the description

 ;;;","17/Jan/24 4:22 PM;simon.auch@vodafone.com;[~ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com] could be the case, but I didn't test other cases.

[~ran.farjun1@vodafone.com], please don't use online json schema validators or publish our json schemas through other channels. Especially validating order jsons that can contain sensitive customer data, as this would most likely be a violation of the GDPR.;;;","17/Jan/24 6:10 PM;simon.auch@vodafone.com;[~ran.farjun1@vodafone.com] the particular changes depend on what kind of porting should happen, which depends on the selection in OSF.

The ""orderCart.serviceLines.kip[0].portingInformation.porting"" object is missing either of these keys (with corresponding objects from the schema):
 * singleConnections
 * allSingleConnections
 * systemConnection

Examples:

porting a single/multiple numbers
{code:java}
""portingInformation"": {
  ""porting"": {
    ""carrier"": {
      ""inhouse"": {
        ""carrierContractCancel"": {
          ""endOfTermDate"": ""2024-02-10"",
          ""endOfTermMode"": ""END_DATE""
        },
        ""carrierId"": ""DEU.VFDE""
      }
    },
    ""singleConnections"": [
      {
        ""areaCode"": ""0176"",
        ""callNumber"": ""1234567""
      }
    ]
  }
}, {code}
porting also non listed numbers:
{code:java}
""portingInformation"": {
  ""porting"": {
    ""carrier"": {
      ""inhouse"": {
        ""carrierContractCancel"": {
          ""endOfTermDate"": ""2024-02-10"",
          ""endOfTermMode"": ""END_DATE""
        },
        ""carrierId"": ""DEU.VFDE""
      }
    },
    ""allSingleConnections"": {
      ""areaCode"": ""0176"",
      ""callNumber"": ""1234567""
    }
  }
}, {code}
The ""systemConnection"" is only relevant for porting whole blocks of phone numbers which I think is not a use case in OSF.

 

Note that for other use cases like handing the porting information in later the structure is different.;;;","17/Jan/24 7:45 PM;ran.farjun1@vodafone.com;this is from the payload:

""portingInformation"": {
                        ""porting"": {

,
                                    ""carrierId"": 8
                                }
                            },
                            ""singleConnections"": [

                            ]
                        }
                    }

is something missing here?
there is singleConnections;;;","17/Jan/24 8:11 PM;simon.auch@vodafone.com;[~ran.farjun1@vodafone.com] according to our logs that part is not present in the request that the ticket description mentions.

The part from the order in the ticket is:
{code:java}

The new request you shared is incorrect because the carrierId must be a string, not a number.

one more thing i need to know, what are the condition to choose one of the 2:

singleConnections

allSingleConnections

 

also need some input on this new error:

im sending here the input to KD + the porting info we got from submit request:

[^input  with single connection.json]

^[^porting info from request.xml]^;;;","18/Jan/24 10:36 PM;simon.auch@vodafone.com;For OSF I would assume that that has to depend on what is selected in the checkout.
For a simple kip order for example you can currently either select to port 1 phone number:
!image-2024-01-18-18-02-24-936.png!

Multiple phone numbers:
!image-2024-01-18-18-02-52-437.png!

Or all phone numbers:
!image-2024-01-18-18-03-27-402.png!

 

What is not clear to me is how the all phone numbers case would be mapped best to the schema.
What does OSF currently send when selecting the all phone numbers option and providing multiple phone numbers?

It seems to me that the case where ""Alle Rufnummern"" is selected and more than one phone number is provided is not supported by v3. 
I'm not sure why this is a use case in OSF, as ""Alle Rufnummern"" should not need all phone numbers to be provided by the customer.

Either the OSF interface must limit this case to a single phone number, the v3 interface must be changed, or the mapping just discards all except one phone number.

The best approach I think would be to adapt the OSF interface to match what the api is actually capable of. I'm not sure if something would break with the last option..;;;","18/Jan/24 11:12 PM;simon.auch@vodafone.com;Regarding the new issue:

The first validation failure looks strange, could you maybe share what your clickflow in OSF was?

The second validation failure might be unrelated to the change itself, could you check if the issue also appears on the other acc environment given the same address and clickflow in OSF?;;;","18/Jan/24 11:32 PM;ran.farjun1@vodafone.com;Hi [~simon.auch@vodafone.com] 

im not using the front-end, i sent the same request as Devi and i just change the mapping that the singleConnections will be in the payload to VKD.

Devi can you please try all scenarios that Simon suggested and add the OGWOrderID.
then we check how its mapped and what OGW need to take or how it will choose between single or allSingleConnections.;;;","19/Jan/24 12:56 PM;ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com;[~ran.farjun1@vodafone.com]  [~simon.auch@vodafone.com]  you can compare to behavior on ACC2, here everything is still working as we have V2 still in place.

Additionally this CR676 is not officially requested for ACC testing, it was just listed as ""Sanity only"" and now we will have a lot of effort to check all possible scenarios for porting (no phone number, 1 phone number, 3 phone numbers, all phone numbers etc.) for VKD as well as for Unitymedia. This effort is not planned.

there is a meeting organized on Monday from [~andreas.baldermann@vodafone.com]  to check how to deal with this CR. 

We need to understand exactly which test cases are mandatory, we cannot test all possible VKD and Unity flows E2E. 

[~ran.farjun1@vodafone.com]  can you share in the meantime all scenarios which were tested from Amdocs for this CR? I have received SIT Testplan but as far as I can see its only one Cable scenario (even not sure if Unity or VKD) - so very much basic. And not all flows (new aquisition, dsl migration, move, vkd and unity with different settings in checkout)

Thanks to all, lets discuss next steps on Monday ;;;","21/Jan/24 4:40 PM;ran.farjun1@vodafone.com;Hi Ari,

Within this test they have changed the shipping fee amount in SAP to 6,99 Euro, and we are using same SAP Testsystem like SIT, thats why we are having this shipping fee visible in our E2E Tests.

By looking at the OA1 logs currently real-time archiving seems to be working fine in PR, as also confirmed by Lac in below mail from DB tables.
 
@Ariadne Thun, Vodafone, Could you please brief the issue you facing due to real-time archiving?
 
@DL_VOIS-VF-DE-AT-TEMS_Team@vodafone.com, 
To de-activate this real-time archiving , we have to set below parameter to false in OM core instances and shut down the OA1(goindr) instance.
File : om-core-env.properties
Parameter: om-core.onedms.archive.active=true
Kindly raise CCR to change the configuration, in case if real time archiving needs to be shut down.
 
CCR - Z_SRT02376962A is raised to make the required changes at PR OM.

Please let us know once changes will be done.

hi [~gokul.vade@vodafone.com] As per our last discussion we noticed that this issue is happening due to check serviceability timeout issue. Also time out issue is happening due to delay of OGW response. Once time out issue is fixed, Ask them to check this issue.

Note: This issue is not reproducible in our local or st Environments.

It looks like that there is a similar problem on PR between system ETOP and SBus:
There are also delays (up to 100 sec) for synchronous messages sent by ETOP to SBus. 

The problem exists more than a week, a PN was created yesterday PN (SPN-ASB-000141483) by project team.
The UAT for ETOP is stopped now

Z_SRT02373483A || INC000083345482 Raised by TEMS Team - PR SBUS Timer sync issue .;;;","22/Dec/23 5:23 PM;rohan.kumbhar@vodafone.com;Response from SBUS Dev:
It looks like that there is a similar problem on PR between system ETOP and SBus:
There are also delays (up to 100 sec) for synchronous messages sent by ETOP to SBus. 

The problem exists more than a week, a PN was created yesterday PN (SPN-ASB-000141483) by project team.
The UAT for ETOP is stopped now

	Could you pls check this problem and take it into account, it looks similar the the VFP-SBus problem!?
;;;","27/Dec/23 1:00 PM;rohan.kumbhar@vodafone.com;We have checked and found in PRSBUS server asocr01 is high load due to this we are facing timeout error.

Due to high load we have restarted SBUS application with MQ. After restart we checked and found load is decreased somehow but again it increasing.

We have checked from DB and user end no long running sessions there.

So we have raised SRT (Z_SRT02373646A || INC000083362457) to HP-UX team to check long running session.

Are you sure this is not just another example of the TV technicians not being initialized correctly by OSF if the TV package is not opened before entering the checkout?

[~ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com] I think the behaviour by OSF that the error message is shown in case a inconsistent technician selection is made by the agent can be assumed to be correct. I at least would not know what the expected outcome of such a selection would be.

The following part from your comment could be the solution to this:

*BUT this is not expected as per Ticket from PROD:*

This means the option for TV is not visible anymore, if I got it right. Therefore there can also not be any mismatch between TV and KIP installation options.

Your assumption regarding the TV section then not being visible is correct.

From our tests I would also assume that the TV section shouldn't be visible in this case [Quelle von vkdTechnicianOptions.feature - productSetup - webgit (kabeldeutschland.de)|https://webgit.kabeldeutschland.de/projects/FE/repos/productsetup/browse/4DevelopmentOnly/tests/unified/features/availability/vkdTechnicianOptions.feature#239-259]:

        And a selection

Yes, exactly, we shouldn't see any of these options anymore for VFW customers. That should already be deployed on ACC2. Once we can confirm it works properly, we can reject this bug (I have never seen this error message, I wonder what causes it).

Hi [~alka.kshirsagar2@vodafone.com] ,

Based on our internal discussion we can say the current issue which is retail specific configurator warning is yet to analyze as this has nothing to do with WA applied.

“As we are getting the DSL package Configurator warning for retail channel based on DSL rules.

[~atharva.paskanthi@vodafone.com]  I discussed same with our BA on when we get such warnings. He also confirmed in this case OSE evaluates the the rules that have ‘operation’ ‘EQL’, ‘MAX’, ‘MIN’, In case the current DSL packages in the shopping cart do not adhere to those rules. then this message is thrown. So lets get this review with help of DSL PCAT team.

HI [~alka.kshirsagar2@vodafone.com]  ,

As per latest discussion with @Balaji Ragothaman on WA I come to know that its just an one time activity to resolve the publish related issue which was causing issue on ACC.

WA is not the reason for the Warning message we are getting on extended shopping cart. Ideally the warning we get is purely based on products on cart which are added by default based on PCAT rules.

@Sandeep Kumar Pradhan already mentioned this WA part on release note or in some document towards VF.

We can conclude this issue as we don't have any open issue related to this and acc is working as expected without any blocker.;;;","17/Jan/24 9:24 PM;ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com;[~vikash.saurav@vodafone.com]  I am not able to get the latest feedback ""that its just an one time activity to resolve the publish related issue which was causing issue on ACC.""

 

We have observed this issue with initial delivery 8.2 directly after deployment
the second time we have observed it with second full delivery directly after deployment

So it happend twice, but you say its one time activity to resolve it? Why was it happening again then with the second full delivery? 

Only after redeployment of second full delivery to ACC1 we did not observe it anymore so its now permanently fixed?;;;","19/Jan/24 12:19 PM;gaurav.lanjewar1@vodafone.com;[~vikash.saurav@vodafone.com]  Any update on this defect?;;;","19/Jan/24 8:37 PM;ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com;We will check the behavior once again after we have deployed next full delivery from TechM to ACC1 Wave 8.2

Fixnet Inlifesales was not able to check, because of [OS-51431] OSF | Wave 8.2 | ACC1/IT | Getting https error for Fixnet LegacySearchResponse and GetCustomerDetails - Vodafone Global Jira

Anyway, I think we can close for now and reopen again if same would happen again. ;;;","29/Jan/24 12:59 PM;ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com;For ILS its also possible to move to checkout without error message today, but as mentioned we were not able to check immediately after deployment. It was now checked only after overnight import and publish was running. Anyway, we do not have any evidence that its still broken so I close the ticket for now

i saw this error in the requests that you send:

Hi Simran,
Based on further analysis identified that this is PCAT data which we get for Footnote products under the fields Footnote text. This text is imported as part of PCAT import and passed to SendDocumentRequest further.

Also this is existing behavior and now if want to correct this then it should be CR or SRT based on discussion with BA.

Could you please discuss with VF BA once and confirm on this.;;;","05/Dec/23 6:33 PM;bharath.krishnamurthy@vodafone.com;Shruti Kanchan

Hi Simran,

Can you please provide the epic number and details.;;;","07/Dec/23 12:56 PM;ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com;It does not need to be part of any requirement. Its *basic German language* to show the real letter instead of replacing it by a question mark.

I double checked in our logs and attached them here as well (cable rules artifact logs), maybe they help.
The scenario I clicked was:
 * load existing KIP customer
 * open kip package
 * open (new) mobile package
 * select any bundle eligible mobile tariff -> bundle drawer pops up
 * create the bundle by clicking the bundle drawer
 * go to checkout -> see message
 * logs of this state: [^cable_rules_artifact_OS47914_pre_workaround.log]
 * open kip package
 * select any option and deselect it again
 * logs of this state:
[^cable_rules_artifact_OS47914_post_workaround.log]

When checking the logs notice that no posting rules are executed after the bundle is created and before the workaround is applied.

Hi Alexander/Simon,

This is not a code issue I have checked working PCAT with the ACC1/ACC2 codebase in my local environment and it's working fine, seems something wrong with the ACC2 PCAT.

I have checked Rules manager and some differences found in the rules also in both the PCAT's so both PCT’s are not same.

*ACC1:*
Total Rules: 73185 
Mobile: 62760
KIP Ruls: 5168
KABLE TV Rules: 4450

*ACC2:*

The problem is, that ACC2 is having January catalogue since today, as PST is testing next release. So maybe first of all the issue has to be reproducable with new catalogue.

Hi Alexander/Simon,
 
 For extended shopping cart min max equal warning rules, there is not relation with cable post rule results or execution.
The rule which is problematic, is a max(0) rule and service to category rule. So if this rule’s service source expression evaluates to true than it will check if cart have max 0 number of products only from the target category. So if product OMNIUSTVCHANGEDMARKER is not part of the package then problematic rule service source expression will evaluate to true and further it will show warning if from target category we have more then 0 products in cart.;;;","14/Dec/23 2:55 PM;simon.auch@vodafone.com;Hi [~bharath.krishnamurthy@vodafone.com],

the relation is implicit, the posting rules select the OMNIUSTVCHANGEDMARKER once there is any change to the package. OSF needs to call the posting rules after any change to cable packages including bundle rules.

Hi Alexander/Simon,
 
The logic implemented long back cannot be modified as it may cause additional adversary problems. However, if you require this logic to be changed, it will require the involvement of design team.;;;","14/Dec/23 4:54 PM;simon.auch@vodafone.com;[~ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com], I am not sure if there was any more specific documentation (I will keep searching for a bit), but the following HLD already has a section:
|*Cable artifact rules*
 
The Cable Catalog and PLM colleagues have requested their own rules engine to be applied in the configurator. This is realised with a plugin development where Cable colleagues can upload their Rules Artifact as part of the PLM process. This Rules Artifact consists of the same Sales Rules (in PHP language/cable-speak) that is used currently in ECC front-ends. OMNIUS will share the full-shoppingcart (all packages) to the Rules Artifact, the rules artifact will process ruling, and return the shoppingcart object with modified cable orderlines in Kabel TV, KIP and KUD packages to be displayed in OMNIUS. The Rules Artifact will be called both before a product is selected (on show of configurator, pre-condition) {*}as well as after selecting a product (on adding to the shoppingcart, post-condition){*}. OMNIUS will not be able to have special GUI handling like for internal OMNIUS sales rules when using the Artifact.|

Highlighting added by me.

From a slightly newer HLD:
|Apart from the Omnius compatibility rules for cable, specific precondition and postcondition rules from cable are also evaluated within the Cable Rules Artifact. *With each change in the configurator (for cable products) the Omnius rules and Cable rules artifact are evaluated in a loop, until a stable state is reached.* |

As explained in the call (and in previous comments on this ticket):

the checkout is blocked by a rule that comes from the pcat because the product OMNIUSTVCHANGEDMARKER is not selected.
the product is added by the posting rules of the cable rules artifact if there is any change to the TV package
after the bundle is created the TV package is changed as it now contains VB4

""nonStandardRate"": 17.64, 

which with VAT makes ~20.99€.

The product itself however does not seem to indicate that it has a price nor a non standard rate, both of which should however not be necessary for unity inventory products.

It is noteworthy that the product itself has no price configured in the product setup, maybe the display in the contract summary of OSF does not work if it is an inventory product without a price (and without a non standard rate actually configured in the product setup)?

The very first analysis was by me and as far as I can tell nothing in the comments suggests that the assumptions I had were analysed?

For the result of my analysis see the first comment [OS-47333] OSF Wave 8.1 ACC2 - Contract Summary: Price of old TV Product is missing (only OSF) - Vodafone Global Jira.

I also checked again for a random customer having this product that the inventory returned by vkdgateway does indeed contain a price.

TL;DR:

This behaviour is reproducible with a vast range of PCAT versions (basically any version containing UMDKLM should suffice).

The product has no price configured, but for (unity) inventory products the price from the inventory must be used. 
VkdGateway correctly returns a price in the inventory of the customer.

We had a call with TechM team to analyse this defect Further and got the below information from them

They compared the back office configuration between one failed scenario(Digitaler Kabelanschluss m. Service ) and pass scenario(Digital Kabelanschluss)

and made the below changes to their environment to check whether it is working with failed scenario:

 

*1.They tried to change the price of the failed product and product frontend visibilty of the failed product same as the Passed one*

i.e They changed the price of Digitaler Kabelanschluss m. Service from 0 to 20,99 in BO and product Visibility as below (Previously only inverntory is selected for thiis product)

!image-2024-02-21-16-14-57-020.png|width=330,height=141!

And then when checked in front end , We are able to see the product details in front end 

 

*2. As we mentioned that price of the Unity Product should not be taken from Back Office*

To check this one , they tried to change one product price from 20,99 to 20 euros in back office in their environment 

When checked in front end , we are able to see the product price has changed from 20,99 to 20 Euros

!image-2024-02-21-16-20-15-601.png|width=718,height=118!

[~devi.jampana@vodafone.com] 

As discussed there is no such handling for this usecase; where Overriding of PCAT price with Customer Ibase for any product.

In Omnius; it always consider customer’s Ibase product price from pcat RMM(reverse Multimapped) or via (service all {{{}GetNonStandardRates{}}})

So this is not a defect ruther i would say it must be CR to have such behaviour handle in Omnius.

I am not the correct person to decide if this is a bug or not, but I also have not heard of any past CRs to change this behaviour.

As [~markus.meissner@vodafone.com] is the application owner of OSF I assume he should be able to provide the necessary decision if a CR should be created for this issue.

As Discussed over the call , Please do find the below outcome of the call

We identified that there are uncertain delays in the OM application queue where for few orders its response to the updateCustomerReactionCall is getting delayed due to which OGW is getting timeout.
Also this we suspect it might be due to some performance of these queue . @Tran, Khang Lac, DXC: from OM side will be checking if something can be done here or is there any difference between IT & PR Environment queue.
@Ran Farjun@Ketaki Bhide@Yamini Majety (151775): Please as a WA can we check if we can help here to put some delay(10-15 secs) from OGW side before triggering the updateCustomerReactionCall towards OM;;;","20/Nov/23 1:42 PM;rohan.kumbhar@vodafone.com;Checking with Amdocs team if any Temp WA is possible or not to delay some time to send the OMCustomerReactionStatus Update call;;;","20/Nov/23 2:37 PM;ran.farjun1@vodafone.com;Hi,
This is will cause performance deration in production so as advised by solution team we cant add delay as a solution;;;","20/Nov/23 7:25 PM;rohan.kumbhar@vodafone.com;Checked with OGW Team. as per them they cannot add delay for the service as it may impact some other flows which cannot be predicted.
So request is to check performance solution on OM side.

As per OM -- issue is with Queues which are responding sometime slow for few orders and its intermittent due to Performance of servers and as of now nothing can be done from dev side to fine tune it

So to conclude on the defect looking at the comments is that either we need to upgrade queues to improve performances or accept as of now with the current intermittent problem faced for Automation flows;;;","22/Nov/23 3:21 PM;rohan.kumbhar@vodafone.com;The below given parameters are part of  ROM_46.01 Hf.4 (OC. 158777), and this OC is not yet installed in IT env.

So in this case the new order id = 900000073 where while searching it is only calculating 73 ignoring all the 0 digits as they are null.
The last 9 digit =9 is been not counted at all as it only does counting until 8 digits which is 00000073

Multiple things are interesting for this order:
 # Natasa did select VP0 in the checkout, but it is missing from the order.
 ## while testing another bug we noticed that the technician options might not be added to the order when the agent selects them in the dropdown.
 # In the IBP VP0 is added to the order because of the rule ""add_VP0_for_ENV_NE4_technician_install_address"" which (among other things) checks 
{code:java}
object installation type is technician-install {code}
(which should correspond to the ""sehbereitschaft"" selected in the OSF checkout)
In contrast to
{code:java}
object availabilities contains self-install {code}
(which should correspond to the address property self-install)

 # If VP0 is not properly added by the dropdown in the checkout as well as not being selected by the rule due to the object installation type not being processed correctly then it might explain why OSF does send WTXN*:
The rule ""modem_mapping_for_new_customer_at_selfinstall_address"" applies either to

 ## new kip customers that select kip + tv without VP0/1V1

 ## new kip customer without tv

 # The first case would be taken by OSF, thus replacing WTX15 with WTXN15. while the IBP will take neither of them, thus not replacing WTX15

I think the first step must be that OSE must analyse why VP0 is not added to the shopping cart when selecting it in the dropdown.

Additionally no cable product logic seems to be executed after the value in the dropdown is selected for the whole rest of the order process, I was under the impression that at least before the checkout overview the cable product logic should be executed again. It would be nice if this could also be checked.

Result: during the checkout I can select 1V1 as a TV technician and TECYESKIP as a KIP technician.
The logs indicate that 1V1 is never passed to cable product logic as selected.
I attached the log of the session.
[^cable_rules_artifact_OS44322.log]

The log should contain an entry like ""1V1|true"" which it does not.

I also reproduced the issue with the mock [Cable_Address_Type_NE4-VVO|https://ash-sb5-telesales.osf.paps-vf.de/agent/account/login?showProductCodes=true&TC_ID=Cable_Address_Type_NE4-VVO] which results in VP0 being selectable in the checkout. Again in the log we cannot find VP0 ever being passed to the cable product logic as selected.

[^cable_rules_artifact_OS44322_VP0.log]

Visiblity in Order overview for product 1V1/VP0 is controlled by PCAT configuration and rules.;;;","29/Sep/23 3:00 PM;simon.auch@vodafone.com;Hi Vikash,
as the logs show the PCAT returns VP0 and 1V1 as visible in this case, so maybe we have a different understanding what ""visible"" in this case means?
My understanding of visible in this case is:
 * the last call of the cable rules plugin by osf returns a list of packages, each containing a list of products.
 * a product is ""visible"" for a dropdown if the property ""visible"" in the last return value of the cable rules plugin for this particular product was ""true"".

 ** this is especially distinct from the ""visibility"" of tariffs in the configurator which depends on more information like:
 *** is the product selected
 *** is it configured to be shown in the configurator
 *** is the product ""visible"" according to the last result of the cable rules plugin

*According to the logs 1V1/VP0 is visible in this case but is never selected by OSF even if the agent selects it in the dropdown*

This is even underlined by the fact that 1V1/VP0 are shown in the dropdown {*}which would not be the case if the were not ""visible""{*}.;;;","03/Oct/23 5:09 PM;dadasaheb.narbat@vodafone.com;Hi [~vikash.saurav@vodafone.com]  Could you please share latest update here and Chage status to InProgress. ;;;","05/Oct/23 1:15 PM;vikash.saurav@vodafone.com;h3.

Hi [~vikash.saurav@vodafone.com] ,
thank you for the investigation.
According to our investigation we do not have any Compatibility Rules that deselect 1V1, and as said before 1V1 also never appears in the input to the cable rules plugin. 
Also check this previous comment for a log: https://jira.sp.vodafone.com/browse/OS-44322?focusedId=2949361&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels:comment-tabpanel#comment-2949361

As things stand there is nothing cable logic can do to deselect the product as the product is never select from the point of view of the cable product logic.

Please investigate on your side why 1V1 is never passed to CREP as selected once it is selected in the shopping cart/checkout.

Best regards

Hi [~simon.auch@vodafone.com]  ,

This issue on Sky or Cable backend we talking above may be related to CR676. Check with VF as we don't have any implementation on OSE for CR676.

Also we have some discussions going on for CR676 with on [OS-44236] SIT1 | Retail/Telesales | CR676 | Cable order is failing with error JSON validation failure - Vodafone Global Jira

[~natasa.dimovic1@vodafone.com] fyi;;;","11/Oct/23 2:53 PM;simon.auch@vodafone.com;Hi Vikash,

I do not think it is related to CR676 as it has nothing to do with the json schema, but a change in that CR could of course have impacted OSE to behave differently. According to my knowledge however CR676 only had OGW impact until recently and should have no impact whatsoever on OSE and with which products OSE calls the cable product logic.

As I said before, from our perspective there is absolutely nothing cable can do about this *because we do not control with which products cable product logic is called by from OSE.*

*Please investigate in OSE why the cable product logic is not called with the product after it is selected in the checkout.* Before this is done there will be nothing we can do to help with this issue, so please refrain to assigning it back to me before this is investigated. If you have further question please set up a meeting with me.

Hi [~natasa.dimovic1@vodafone.com] 

As already mentioned you that this defect we have fixed on the rule level where the 1V1 was not sent as selected true. After fix this is sent as selected true to Cable artifact rule. Next Cable artifact process the input and send back final list which should be present in cart.

This can be verified by enabled Cable artifact rules on ACC and verify that 1V1 is sent on rules input for the package or not.

We can verify If we are sending 1V1 as true or false on artifact rule log file. If sending as true then plugin has to return the selected product back to OSE to keep that file in cart.

Please check and confirm;;;","09/Nov/23 5:41 PM;natasa.dimovic1@vodafone.com;Hi [~simon.auch@vodafone.com] could you please check the last comment?

the problem only seems to appear for addresses that allow 1V1 (instead of VP0).
One such address: Hagelstangestr. 30, München;;;","06/Dec/23 8:20 PM;simon.auch@vodafone.com;I further analysed this issue and found the following:

Orders created by OSF contain a field 
{code:json}
""apartmentDetails"":{""technicianNeeded"":
true/false
}
{code}
As far as I can tell from tests the field is always true if and only if the agent selected the technician_yes option in either the TV or the KIP dropdown during the checkout.

This information should also be passed to the cable rules plugin, in the field `IServiceAddress::technicianNeeded`.

After the selection of technician options in the dropdown the cable posting rules are executed again by OSF, but the the `technicianNeeded` field is not set to true (as it should be if the agent previously selected VP0/TECYESKIP in the technician dropdowns).

This can be checked by searching for `technicianNeeded` in the following log: [^cable_rules_artifact_OS44322_technicianNeeded.log] 
Notice that the last execution contains `TECYESKIP|true`, since the agent selected the kip technician to be necessary.

For fixing this bug the cable rules artifact logs can be used to check if the technician needed flag is passed to the cable rules plugin correctly.
In the meantime we will try to provide a workaround that might resolve most of the issues as well. We have an experimental workaround since version V2330_2024_01_00_032.

Okay, let me go through your message step by step.

For the first test case:
 * I can reproduce it :)
 * I think that only the TV dropdown is shown is correct (according to the up to now still best documentation we have: [Scenario dimension ""Technician appointment"" - OSF - Vodafone Global Confluence|https://confluence.sp.vodafone.com/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=103985437]).
 * I think VP0 being selectable is also correct (again according to above documentation, and to some tests we have [Quelle von vkdTechnicianOptions.feature - productSetup - webgit (kabeldeutschland.de)|https://webgit.kabeldeutschland.de/projects/FE/repos/productsetup/browse/4DevelopmentOnly/tests/unified/features/availability/vkdTechnicianOptions.feature#216-236]).
 * VP0 disappearing afterwards sounds problematic and without investigating I have no idea why it would.
 ** VP0 not being selected anymore however explains that my workaround doesn't work because it relied on the presence of the technician options instead of the flag.

For the second case:
 * I can reproduce the behaviour :)
 * I don't understand the problem with this though? For this particular example you can proceed either with no technician at all (TECNOKIP, TECNOTV are both selectable) or with a technician (TECYESKIP, 1V1 can be selected together).
 * If the issue is the error message, what would be the expected behaviour if a different technician selection would be made by the agent?
 * If the issue is that the TV dropdown is visible at all: that confuses me a bit as well, since our tests would indicate that only the kip options should be shown in this case: [Quelle von vkdTechnicianOptions.feature - productSetup - webgit (kabeldeutschland.de)|https://webgit.kabeldeutschland.de/projects/FE/repos/productsetup/browse/4DevelopmentOnly/tests/unified/features/availability/vkdTechnicianOptions.feature#239-259]

The answer why the whole section is missing can only be given by OSF.

If I had to guess I would assume OSF is hardcoded to check for TECYESKIP, TECNOKIP, UMTECKIP:NOO, UMTECKIP:YES. One of the relevant tests in our test suite is likely:
{code:java}
    Scenario: New cable TV (KAA) and KIP customer without self-install on NE4-VVO address
        Given a KDG service address where ""analog and digital"" TV is available with object category ""NE4-VVO""
        And a KDG service address where internet with data transfer rate ""1000"" is available
        And self-install is 'not available'
        And a selection
            | productCode |
            | TC2         |
            | 01H:B06     |
        When I get the availability and basket
        Then the products have the states
            | productCode  | state         |
            | TC2          | selected      |
            | 01H:B06      | selected      |
            | TECNOKIP     | not available |
            | TECYESKIP    | not available |
            | TECNOTV      | not available |
            | TECYESTV     | not available |
            | VP0          | selectable    |
            | 1V1          | not available |
            | UMTECKIP:NOO | not available |
            | UMTECKIP:YES | not available | {code}
According to my understanding no kip technician is needed at VVO addresses since the TV technician will handle the installation.
As with the other bug tickets I think we need clarification from business what the expected behaviour is.

Hi [~ajay.yashwantbhavar@vodafone.com] 

 

On further detailed analysis I identified this issue regarding company contact person looks not working from the very beginning if we open offer or search offer from new session which means if we fetch the data from DB and show on FE instead from session when offer created.

I have identified the root cause why the detailed are not stored in DB and as result was not populated on FE.

TC_12 Perform New Solstice Activation and Validate Delivery Section
But observed with all stacks.

we observed that Identisch mit Serviceadresse is not getting removed if we edit the address again from the same page and use the same address like service address

Steps to Reproduce:
1) Login to Telesales channel using any agent
2) perform serviceavailability and configure solstice package
3) Move to extended shopping and add customer details
4) add same address as service address and move forward
5) On delivery section page check delivery options in drop down
6) there should be 3 options visible as per cable behavior
7) from the same page try changing the address again other than service address clicking on pencil symbol(edit button)
8) which should see the new option out of 3 as ""Identisch mit Serviceaddresse"" (total 4)
9) again goto edit button in order to edit the customer details page and rechange the address and use the same address like service address
10 ) And check the delivery section details again it should be now 3 options to select, which is not working

Expected Result:
Making changes of address other than service address or same like service should also change the number of options to select in delivery section

Actual Result:
Changing addresses from the same page of delivery section is not also reflecting the number of options to select in delivery section


*Understanding:*
Using Customer address as service address in customer details page should enable below options:
1. Identical to customer address
2. Delivery to different postal address
3. Delivery to DHL Packstation

Thank you!;;;","21/Sep/23 1:42 PM;simon.auch@vodafone.com;Hi Natasa, just for my understanding: what is the impact of not booking VP0?
As far as I understand the relevant BI order for TV is created anyway, right?
It's just that the customer might not get an information on the CS/confirmation letter that a technician will be sent out?

I think this is a cable bug, [~benjamin.sachse@vodafone.com] can you prioritize this in our backlog?;;;","21/Sep/23 1:49 PM;natasa.dimovic1@vodafone.com;Hi [~simon.auch@vodafone.com] yes, I think the only impact is, that the customer does not see this information in the CS. I'm not sure if it is also an impact, that ANS is not booked, if VP0 is booked. If VP0 would be booked, then ANS is also booked.

 ;;;","21/Sep/23 5:30 PM;simon.auch@vodafone.com;*Guess:* 
Cable product logic tries to rebuild the selection of the agent in each step. This means that certain clickflows are not really supported.

If their are for example two products A and B, A is visible, B is not, selecting A replaces A with B.
If the agent now selects A, A will be added to the selection and the product logic will replace it with B, the agent will see B in the selection.
If the cable product logic is executed again B is not a valid selection because it is not visible.

In this case A would be VP0, and B would be 1V1.

I do not think that there is a simple fix for this issue if my guess is correct.

The two options I see:
 # do not restrict the visibility of VP0 in this case
 ** this would imply that the agent could directly select VP0
 ** since VP0 and 1V1 are mapped to the same dropdown option in OSF -> the agent can only select VP0 together with 1V1, the replacement of 1V1 with VP0 then actually just removes 1V1 since VP0 is already selected.
 # maybe 1V1 should not be selectable in the first place
 ** instead of allowing the agent to select 1V1 which will automatically be replaced with VP0 allow the agent to select VP0 directly instead.

*Open questions:*

Which option is preferred by business?
 * if option 2 is preferred: should this also applied to other portals

What exactly are the affected cases? 
 * likely all test cases where the rule that replaces 1V1 with VP0 applies. 
 * Can business confirm that all cases affected by the rule below should be changed with either option 1 or 2?
 * The rule is: 

{code:java}
Rule 'Replace_1V1_with_VP0_when_ordering_KAI':
When
    selected products contain '1V1' and
    condition 'new_kip_order' applies and
    condition 'digitalSelected' applies
then
    deselect '1V1' and
    select 'VP0' with contract relation set to the main analog product. {code}
 ;;;","27/Sep/23 2:10 PM;nina.pickl@vodafone.com;As agreed yesterday, the issue will be discussed by the Ash team with Christian Lienbacher, regarding the expectations from a business perspective.;;;","27/Sep/23 6:46 PM;fabian.keilbach@vodafone.com;Analysis by Team Ash so far:
 * In case the scenario is reproduced as outlined in the ticket none of 1V1 or VP0 ever gets in the selection of the Cable Rules Plugin even when 1V1 is selected in the frontend
 * In case of ONLY booking TV (no KIP), we can select 1V1 in the frontend as expected and also see it in our Cable Rules Plugin logs 

We thus are lead to believe this is a problem of the frontend not putting the correct (or any) product in the selection in the defect case and therefore require a retest by techM in the following manner
 * Scenario to be reproduced shall be the flow described as steps to reproduce in the ticket
 * Cable logging enabled as in below image:
!crep-logging.png!
 * afterwards attach the cable rule plugin logs to this ticket

We did our analysis together with @Timo Hurai on OSE side and found the problematic checkout product 1V1 is not allowed after Processing of post cable rules. Below are the list of products which are allowed as part of cart after saving change provider details.
 
 {{=== THE FOLLOWING PRODUCTS SHOULD BE PRESENT IN CART AFTER CABLE POST CONDITION: CKH8, SN3, MFT, KH8, CD5, DH5, HDC:000, DV2:T02, TC2, DCX, SC, TOEVN, 9I0:B00, HO1:000, PC1:B01, AO0, FM4:B00, VSA, PAS, 01H:B06, OF5:B00, 69K, V3G, V3K, MTV, WTX21, 3K6, TECYESKIP, KIPOPENEDMARKER}}
First before post cable rules processing the product we added into cart please find below screenshot

But after some seconds once the Post cable rules processing happened we removed the product becuase its not part of allowed list.
 
 {{=== REMOVED FROM CART PROD WITH SKU: 1V1 ===}}
Please find attached screenshot from DB after post processing of cable rules.

!image-2023-10-05-13-09-30-710.png!

For Cable packages we don’t compatibility rules on OSE side, addition / deletion of cable products from cart depend on Cable Pre/Post rules. Kindly assign back this with above information and also I am attaching the CableOmniusRules.log where we can find the details of on same.

According to our investigation we do not have any Compatibility Rules that deselect 1V1, and as said before 1V1 also never appears in the input to the cable rules plugin. 
For completeness we attach the log of the cable rules plugin so you can check for yourself that 1V1 is never passed to the cable product logic as selected: [^cable_rules_artifact372637.log] 

When working with the log searching for ""1V1|true"" and ""1V1|false"" returns the corresponding input state of the product. You will find that no entry exist for ""1V1|true"".

As things stand there is nothing cable logic can do to deselect the product as the product is never select from the point of view of the cable product logic.

Please investigate on your side why 1V1 is never passed to CREP as selected once it is selected in the shopping cart (as seen in one of your screenshots).

Best regards

Hi [~natasa.dimovic1@vodafone.com] 

As already mentioned you that this defect we have fixed on the rule level where the 1V1 was not sent as selected true. After fix this is sent as selected true to Cable artifact rule. Next Cable artifact process the input and send back final list which should be present in cart.

This can be verified by enabled Cable artifact rules on ACC and verify that 1V1 is sent on rules input for the package or not.

We can verify If we are sending 1V1 as true or false on artifact rule log file. If sending as true then plugin has to return the selected product back to OSE to keep that file in cart

 

Please check and confirm ;;;","09/Nov/23 5:39 PM;natasa.dimovic1@vodafone.com;Hi [~simon.auch@vodafone.com] could you please check the last comment? Thank you;;;","13/Nov/23 3:54 PM;simon.auch@vodafone.com;Hi [~natasa.dimovic1@vodafone.com],
I can confirm that 1V1 is now passed to the product logic, which I think removes it because no TV technician is needed (due to kip no self install).
Is this still a major bug, given that the correct technician orders in BI are created as far as I understand the ticket?
I think this should be analysed together with the other CR716 related issues [~ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com] ;;;","28/Dec/23 6:41 PM;atharva.paskanthi@vodafone.com;Hi Team,

The error message “Service PIN ist bei diesem Kunden nicht vorhanden” is displayed when Omnius gets the GET Call response from DXL with error code 404.

Index search,,We receive 2 customer results one with cable and one with mobile, Hence you don’t see the SPIN message

as it is applicable for cable only

!image-2024-02-09-12-06-25-114.png!

Now when you did legacy search, the response had only cable and there was no mobile customer returned

hence it is cable only ,SPIN is applicable here and we show the message.

for the first point if the customer has spin assigned, then we need to see the DXL logs to check if we are getting the pin

and for the second point ,For the linked customer which have only cable stack ,SPIN is applicable

Hello [~lukas.haes1@vodafone.com]  ,

Spin is applicable for cable linked with cable subscriber, if the linked customer has different stack then it is not applicable.

Hi Natasa,

When we search a cable customer ,the getCustomerResponse has below result which is indicating that it's linked customer but has only cable details from OGW, You see *NO* other stack data, Hence OSF considers this as a cable customer and sends a get request for indices to DXL (as service PIN is applicable)

but we get no indices from DXL ,so we have to fallback to standard authentication with an error message.

Hi Natasa,
 
 
 Cable customer details are what we are getting the single result from the response for GetCustomerInfo (even for linked customers the Authentication method will work for each of the stack that are associated.

We would like to get the DXL logs to debug this further

Could you please provide DXL logs .;;;","01/Mar/24 4:31 PM;natasa.dimovic1@vodafone.com;At the moment it is not possible to get the DXL logs, because the SPIN engine is connected to test2b.

it is required that there should be no differnce between the searches (Legacy and Index)!

Additional to that IF a linked customer (MOB&CABLE) is loaded and identified that NO SPIN request should be triggered and standard authentication window (without any SPIN message) should be shown.

[~natasa.dimovic1@vodafone.com]  we are getting 2 different response for the same customer from ogw

for index we get mobile +cable

for legacy we get cable only

in this case spin will not be applicable for index but for legacy as we receive only cable ,ose considers it as cable customer.

How is it OSE issue?

maybe we need to set up a call again.

this is what i can see from the requests:
1. in index search we are searching with link id, so OGW return mobile and cable customer.

2. in legacy search we are searching only the cable customer so we are returning only cable customer data.

is something else is expected?

We have a mutually-exclusive category X ( here: access hardware)

 

If any of this Product A of X is chosen than a Product P (here: Product 10004 Shipping_Fee) should be Defaulted.

Only Exception: if Product B of X (here: Eigenhardware) is choosen, than Product P should not be added

 

We build a rule (here: CR006048)

If not B than defaulted-obligated P (Prio 6)
 
First Result:

If we switch from A to B P stay in the cart

 

I added an additional Prio 1 rule: If P is in the cart -> Do not allow P.

 

Result:

If we switch from A to B P is removed, which is fine.

But if I switch back from B to A I get the error

{color:#FF0000}*Die folgenden Produkte: [10004] Versandkosten können nicht hinzugefügt werden weil sie mit der aktuellen Auswahl nicht kombinierbar sind.*{color}

 

+*Expected Result:*+

Product 10004 should be defaulted or removed just by the rule CR006048, no other rule neccessary

 

 

*Steps to reproduce:*

*-ProcessContext ACQ*
 # *Enter any address.*
 #  *Choose any tarif -> A hardware is defaulted*
 # *Switch to hardware Eigenhardware*
 # *Switch back to any other access hardware -> error message is shown*

First of all we have found a workaround to make this particular business rule working.

However we still have the issue with a defaulted Product P and the check !cart.contains(P)

 

The example here is:

We have a (initial) default rule. If agent selects tariff A default hardware P. Of course this rule is true also in further runs of compRules

Agent switches manually to other hardware Q of this mutually exclusive category

If we have two distinguish rules:
 # cart.containsProduct(P) -> default product X 
 # !cart.containsProduct(P) -> Not ALLOW X 

We get this kind of error message: X cannot be added 

 

Regardless if the first or the second rule gets a higher prio we always run into trouble that either the product is added (but should not) or we get the above error message.

Please explain how to build the rules to make it working the whole time;;;","06/Nov/23 4:14 PM;saiswarup.singhdeo@vodafone.com;[~vikash.saurav@vodafone.com]  Any update on this defect ?;;;","06/Nov/23 5:24 PM;vikash.saurav@vodafone.com;hi [~marco.abraham01@vodafone.com]  can you please share non-working PCAT to reproduce this issue because earlier pcat file which you shared is failing while import.

To have a workaround in place, Marco did some changes on his side, but this is not permanent solution! its just a workaround until TechM has fixed the behavior with permanent fix.

TechM has to give a fix for it, so Marco can remove his workaround.

Can you please look into the below comment

 

Regards

Srujana;;;","20/Sep/23 4:07 PM;simon.auch@vodafone.com;This can be changed on cable side, but I am relatively sure that this was never implemented for Unity.

Without CR-716 the agent could select both ""Anschluss ist bereits sehbereit"" or ""Anschluss ist nicht sehbereit"" but only ""Anschluss ist bereits sehbereit"" would actually do anything (selecting a marker product).

With CR-716 only the option with a valid product selection is left, but functionally everything behaves just like before.
The agent basically just had the illusion of a choice before.

If this behaviour should be changed I think it needs to be clarified if there are other cases for unity in which (at a self install address) the option ""Anschluss ist nicht sehbereit"" should be selectable. The other ES* products come to mind for example.;;;","22/Sep/23 4:50 PM;nina.pickl@vodafone.com;In clarification:

the technician option should be shown if KIP only is booked or is there an exception when booking ES5? If yes, then I would say the wrong option is displayed. Here the VKD defect which was already solved: [OS-42931] OSF | ACC2 | Wave 8.1 | CR716-Futurize | when booking ES5 on a Selfinstall address where ABK = no, no value is available in the access details - Vodafone Global Jira. Thank you;;;","03/Feb/25 1:16 PM;tobias.pohlmann@vodafone.com;Hi [~natasa.dimovic1@vodafone.com]  ,
as I understood it, the technician section should never be shown for a KIP-only booking.

In the excel sheet, there are only 2 cases left in which we want to show the section in OSF, which are both TV-only cases.
!image-2025-02-03-08-44-34-740.png|width=1339,height=527!

Where did you find that the section _should_ be shown? Maybe I missed that?;;;","03/Feb/25 1:24 PM;natasa.dimovic1@vodafone.com;Hi [~tobias.pohlmann@vodafone.com] {*}SORRY{*}, I wanted to write ""the technician option should *NOT* be shown if KIP only is booked"". For this use case, described in the description, the technician option is still displayed in the Access Details.

We are not sure if everything has already been implemented.

If everything has already been implemented then I would suggest to reject this bug. A new bug should be created then. Could you please check if there is maybe a bug on Cable side? Thank you;;;","03/Feb/25 1:33 PM;tobias.pohlmann@vodafone.com;Ah, okay, now I get it.

The reason why it happens here is that this is a Unity address which historically was treated similarly, but differently than VKD with the technician options.

As we have earlier informed and discussed that the cataline.out log file is big in size. Still, we have managed to share complete log files as asked by you.

The target 20090213 is defined as DEFAULT, not DEFAULT OBLIGATED.
But even though, the product 20090213 cannot be deselected.
The software team must fix this issue, so the target product 20090213 is going to be put into shopping cart as default, but could be deselected anytime by agent if necessary.

Step on OSF GUI 
============
1. search customer, any string
2. click on ""Paket Ändern"" change package
3. select a DTAG tarif
4. select any hardware which is not Fritzbox 5590

if you check the attached files, the zip file with the biggest filesize is the pcat-config data. You could import it use your tool plm.php.
I even send you the test stub FN_ILS_FTTH_DTAG.zip for that, so you could reproduce the error in your environemnt.
The Log file would also show you how it was running in our environement.
The number of TTWOS ticket is attached on the ticket, so you could find all the info about the customer there.
Why you need the prod data, if I already send you the test stubs used the anonymized data.

Hi [~shuyan.luo@vodafone.com]  ,

Based on the code investigation, it appears that this is not a issue, the manual_override_allowed field value is 0 in the catalog_package_subtypes table which is why its not allowing to deselect the hardware.

When the PCAT files are imported, the values of this field are set according to the values available in the PCAT files, so if the PCAT file does not contain this filed value for any stack, the value is considered to be 0.

When the manual_override_allowed field is set to 1 for a fixed stack, then the hardware can be deselected in the configurator according to the value in the manual_override_allowed field.

!image-2023-11-10-12-33-31-352.png!;;;","10/Nov/23 4:45 PM;shuyan.luo@vodafone.com;The attribute manual_override_allowed delete too much, so it couldn't be used as workaroud to fix our issue.

We identified the root cause of this issue and suggested to have mutual override allow enabled for sub package having these hardwares. but this was causing some other issues which i discussed with Marco and Shuyan.

I am trying with existing expression to fix this issue if not then next step would be to have a new expression which will override the logix written for mutual exclusive categories.

We analyzed the debug logs from the ACC environment and concluded, that our developed PCAT rules are executing correctly. Especially because the rules work as expected on our sandboxes, we cannot explain the different behavior with the same software version on ACC and PROD.

That why we assume an environment problem or a software bug.

When we are checking the logs, we can find that CRFN314 is evaluating to true.

[~natasa.dimovic1@vodafone.com]  The issue isn't valid issue because we tested on local with the stub, which worked on SB1, and it is working fine, if it’s a software issue in that case it should not work in the local environment with the stubbed customer.

if this is code issue then it should not work in Tech Test and dev environment. ;;;","29/Sep/23 7:38 PM;shuyan.luo@vodafone.com;*Is this a joke, that you guys assigned this ticket to somebody, who is responsible for reference data configuration :-D*

It is many time said, that with the same version OSE and PCAT, different behavior are given on different test servers.
So the reason could be:
- the (standard-)libs which OSE software included, are not in the same version on different server
- the webserver, or the workframes on which OSE are running do not have the same version or same configuration on different test servers ...

There could be many reasons, which could be investigated by software developers or admins for test servers, BUT NEVER somebody, who are delivering reference datas (product catalogues) :-D

So I would assign the ticket back to developer team, they should write down the instructruction or installation guide for the deployment team, so that the admins for test servers could check, which system configuration maybe wrong due the installation/instruction guide.

[~natasa.dimovic1@vodafone.com]  We have checked two PCATS with the same code base one is from sb1 environment which is working as expected and another one from the acc1 that is probably published from the dtl4 which is not working properly.

As per our initial investigation it looks like the product C_comfort is removed because it has been considered mutually exclusive product which is why it is removing from the cart.

Hi [~natasa.dimovic1@vodafone.com]  We don't see any issue in our code, as we are completely dependent on cable artifact results and somehow in case of selecting KIP and then Cable TV, we are not getting this product from the cable which is why it is not reflected in the checkout section so please check with the cable team.

can you provide on which information it depends whether or not OSF displays the access details for TV and for KIP?
If this depends on certain product states it would be valuable to know for example which products, which property of this product etc.
If this depends on certain address properties it would be important to know on which address properties like tags, flags, etc.

It would be perfect if you could provide this information for both software versions on the ACC1 (v9.16.6-BB1) and the ACC2 (v9.17.0-BB46).

Thank you very much

Hi [~simon.auch@vodafone.com] 

The cable artifact logs already attached in data.zip file also I am sharing the details related to SKU which are behaving differently when swapping the package in configurator.

 

*Software version:* 

ACC2 - v9.17.0-BB46 2023-08-22 12:17 |08-29|02-49 

ACC1 - v9.16.6-BB1 2023-08-13 12:21 |08-28|22-0

*Not Working Scenario:* For the TECNOTV and TECYESTV SKU in the logs output section Visible, selected attributes getting false also is selectable missing.

!image-2023-08-30-16-34-51-454.png!

*Working Scenario:* For working SKU TECNOTV and TECYESTV SKU in logs, we can see visible and changeable attributes are true and is selectable also present there.

thank you for providing the examples, but I was hoping for the actual decisions OSF makes in order to determine whether or not to show the access details during the checkout.
Examples are in this case not sufficient to correctly determine the severity of the problem. 
After knowing the decisions OSF makes I would for example want to be able to now if OSF shows the access details if the cable product logic returns TECNOTV, TECYESTV, 1V1 as not visible, and VP0 as visible.

Thank you and Regards,

Nina;;;","21/Sep/23 1:21 PM;saiswarup.singhdeo@vodafone.com;[~benjamin.sachse@vodafone.com] Any update when it will be fixed ?;;;","21/Sep/23 4:32 PM;simon.auch@vodafone.com;In order to properly fix this I assume that cable and OSF will have to deliver a fix.

According to the answer from [~vikash.saurav@vodafone.com]  https://jira.sp.vodafone.com/browse/OS-42115?focusedId=2910953&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels:comment-tabpanel#comment-2910953 the display of the tv access details depends on the availability of the products TECNOTV and TECYESTV reported by the cable logic.

*Why does the workaround work?*

My *assumption* is that OSF remembers the availability of TECNOTV and/or TECYESTV from a previous execution of the cable logic.

If KIP is selected first, then the first executions of the cable product logic will return TECNOTV and TECYESTV as not available. 

If TV is selected first, then the first executions of the cable product logic will return either TECNOTV and/or TECYESTV as available.

-> This is something that has to be fixed by OSF

{*}What is the implication of the Workaround?{*}{*}{{*}}

Assuming cable product logic would return TECNOTV or TECYESTV as bookable the issue might persist in OSF, since as long as KIP is selected first TECNOTV and TECYESTV will still not be available from the start.

*Open questions from my perspective:*
 * which products exactly control the display of the tv access details in OSF?
 ** Is it only TECYESTV and TECNOTV or also products like VP0, 1V1?
 ** Is this controlled by special tags on products or categories, or are the products hardcoded in OSF?
Maybe [~vikash.saurav@vodafone.com] can answer this question?
 *  in which scenarios should which technician option be bookable in OSF?

 * 
 ** we have a list of ~80 test cases. Some of these are apparently not correct.
 ** Who can go through these test cases with us and determine which of them need to be changed?
 ** Without at least a contact person that can answer this question it will not make sense to start implementation of this ticket.

Following is the answer to the query to show Access details or New connection section for KIP and Kable TV.

For the section to be visible, the cable artifact result must contain at least one product matching the option types.

technician_needed_no 
technician_needed_yes

If there is no result for those options, the section will not be displayed.

It is hard to give an exact timing for this feature since it seems to have been implemented a long time ago. I recommend contact with Vodafone BA for more information.

so, PORPDT-345 will not make this requirement obsolete, it will just slightly shift how it looks.

The new requirements are: if only TV is ordered, show the section. If TV + Internet is ordered, don't show it.

The new problem is this:
If the agent books the packages in the following order
 * TV
 * KIP

then the TV accessibility section is shown, but it should not.

The problem is still the same as described by [~simon.auch@vodafone.com] in the comment from 21/Sep/2023: 
OSF seems only to decide on whether to show the accessibility section for TV when the TV package is opened. So,
 * we first open TV and book a TV Connect ---> OSF sees that 1V1 and TECNOTV are available and correctly assumes that it should show the TV accessibility section
 * we then open the internet section and book some GigaZuhause tariff ---> from now on, 1V1 and TECNOTV are not available anymore, but OSF seems to not update its opinion on the TV accessibility and will display it anyway
 * IF the user just simply opens the TV package again (without changing anything), OSF updates again and will correctly NOT display it

This is something we cannot fix and still need a change from OSF.;;;","13/Jun/24 3:31 PM;ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com;[~tobias.pohlmann@vodafone.com]  I am not able to get your comment

But after the changes in PORPDT-345, this behaviour now _is_ okay and exactly what we want.

 

The new problem is ""first book TV -> then book KIP -> access details for TV ARE displayed -> {*}NOT OK{*}""

Thank you for the re-test.

The failure in case 2, where the technician option for KIP is wrongly displayed, is again the OSF bug discussed further below:
- when you book KIP first, then OSF calculates the technician option it wants to show for KIP, which is for a pure KIP order on an self-install address currently ""Anschluss ist sehbereit"".

- when you then book TV, it will not update the technician option it wants to show for KIP, and just show it regardless.

- when you just simply open the KIP package after the TV selection again, OSF _will_ update its opinion and not show the KIP technician section.

We cannot do anything here on our side and would need a fix from TechM side, so that OSF will always update both the TV and KIP technician section, no matter which package is currently opened.

 

About the ""Verbindungsdaten speichern"" field I don't know much unfortunately --neither how it is controlled nor what the desired logic behind it is.;;;","01/Jul/24 7:53 PM;ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com;[~tobias.pohlmann@vodafone.com]  we see a mismatch in behavior in case we book Broadvision KIP or different KIP 

For broadvision KIP its working as described by Timo Russo


Book BV KIP first, then TV -> section for technician is not displayed ->  {color:#00875a}*OK*{color}
Book other KIP first, then TV -> section for technician is displayed -> {color:#de350b}*NOT OK*{color}

{color:#de350b}*Can you confirm that for other KIP then BV also section for technician should be removed?*
{color}

{color:#172b4d}Its not about booking TV first, and then KIP. We handle this use case separately, we are aware that there might be an issue.
*But for now we only want to understand the behavior for  [[PORPDT-345]|https://de.jira.agile.vodafone.com/browse/PORPDT-345]*{color};;;","02/Jul/24 3:06 PM;tobias.pohlmann@vodafone.com;Hi, Ariadne,

{*}{color:#de350b}yes, I can confirm that in any case where we book KIP + TV (no matter if Broadvision or not, no matter which order we book it in), no technician section should be shown{color}{*}. 

The reason why this fails is as I tried to point out in my comment below. It really is pretty confusing, I apologize for that. I had a call with Natasa where I explained the problem, because it really is a bit hard to grasp.

So again in case of Broadvision what happens is:
 - [In the KIP package] KIP is booked, TV Connect is added because of Broadvision ---> OSF understands that no section for KIP should be shown because KIP + TV is booked and remembers that

 - [In the TV package] TV Digital is booked ---> OSF understands that no section for TV should be shown because KIP+TV is booked

==> no KIP or TV technician section is shown

In case of Not-Broadvision:
 - [In the KIP package] Only KIP is booked, but not TV yet ----> OSF supposes that a technician section should be shown for KIP (because only KIP is booked) and remembers that
 - [In the TV package] TV Digital + TV Connect is booked ----> OSF understands that no section for TV should be shown because KIP+TV is booked, but doesn't update the reasoning for KIP

==> technician section is shown for KIP, but not for TV;;;","09/Jul/24 5:42 PM;natasa.dimovic1@vodafone.com; ** There was a change on PCAT side: [[PORPDT-345] BV - Removal of Ready-to-Watch (Sehbereitschaft) Section - DE Jira (vodafone.com)|https://de.jira.agile.vodafone.com/browse/PORPDT-345]

 * If the display of the checkout part is only controlled by TECYESTV and TECNOTV, this will not work (and from cable side never should have) for Unity, since these two products are not aligned and should never be available for Unity.
Which TV technician option should be bookable in Unity TV scenarios? As far as I am aware there is no TV technician product that is available in the Unity footprint.
 *  in which scenarios should which technician option be bookable in OSF?

 * 
 ** we have a list of ~80 test cases. Some of these are apparently not correct.
 ** Who can go through these test cases with us and determine which of them need to be changed?
 ** Without at least a contact person that can answer this question it will not make sense to start implementation of this ticket.

If this worked before, then:

1) the display of the section does not only depend on TECHNOTV or TECHYESTV in VFW cases and/or

2) the OSF behaviour controlling this section in VFW scenarios changed

As I said before, none of our tv technician products should be selectable in VFW cases as none of them is aligned, the answer https://jira.sp.vodafone.com/browse/OS-42115?focusedId=2910953&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels:comment-tabpanel#comment-2910953 therefore cannot apply in VFW cases.

I would suggest assigning this ticket to OSF in order to understand:
1) when the section is shown and

2) when the section was shown in the last known working version

Do we know of a working version?

If we are following the below steps in ACC2 then we are able to see the Access details even now:

Steps:

1)select TV Product and KIP section 

2)select the TV Product

3)Donot select any product in KIP

4)Move forward it will throw an error that we have to select the KIP Product in check out section

5)Go back and select the KIP Product now

6)Move forward and fill customer details

7)Then we are able to see the access details for TV

Note:we tried this steps 3 to 4 times and we are able to see the access details once

Strange behaviour

This issue can be related to any VKD Permissions?

Srujana;;;","28/Sep/23 8:02 PM;simon.auch@vodafone.com;Hi Devi & Nina,

[~devi.jampana@vodafone.com] for now I would ignore the case you had and focus on the scenario described in the ticket: a TV order without KIP.
I think my initial question is still unanswered:
When does OSF show the access details section for TV in a unity scenario?

If the answer to this question is ""when at least one product in the technician_needed_no or technician_needed_yes category is visible according to the cable product logic"" then the next question we need answered is why was the section shown in previous versions?

[~nina.pickl@vodafone.com] could you figure out a version where this worked last time?;;;","28/Sep/23 8:18 PM;simon.auch@vodafone.com;According to an answer from Vikash in another ticket [OS-42115] OSF | ACC2 | Wave 8.1 | CR716 Futurize regression defect | when booking KIP and TV the access details for TV are not displayed - Vodafone Global Jira
""It is hard to give an exact timing for this feature since it seems to have been implemented a long time ago. I recommend contact with Vodafone BA for more information.
Unity Media works exactly the same as normal Kable TV and KIP products to display the access details section."".
To me this is a direct conflict to the information that this ever worked in the (recent) past.
Without a specific version in which it worked before I have the feeling this discussing is not leading anywhere.

If we want to change this we need a requirement from Business regarding which tv technician options to align for unity or accept that the tv access details are not shown in unity cases.;;;","29/Sep/23 12:27 PM;nina.pickl@vodafone.com;Hi [~simon.auch@vodafone.com],

 ;;;","17/Oct/23 3:05 PM;simon.auch@vodafone.com;Hi Devi,

I have no clue what OSF is doing here, but definitely not how it should behave to the best of my knowledge.
I could reproduce the issue and make the following two screenshots:
!image-2023-10-17-11-31-41-319.png!
!image-2023-10-17-11-32-04-497.png!

Which shows that OSF thinks that 1V1/VP0/TECYESTV/TECNOTV should be selected. That is not correct since the last execution of the cable product logic up to that point in the checkout process returns none of these 4 products as visible.
For completeness I attached the log of the session up to the dropdown in the checkout: [^cable_rules_artifact_OS42066.log]

Please find out when the access details are shown in the checkout. All information until now seems to conflict with the unity case. Maybe there is a special handling for unity addresses hardcoded in OSF?;;;","19/Oct/23 11:57 AM;ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com;Hi [~simon.auch@vodafone.com]  

regarding ""All information until now seems to conflict with the unity case"" -> for CR716 we have raised also defects for VKD and not only for Unity, so something is in general wrong in this access details section.

As the latest observation happened after having new broadvision product catalogue in place, should we raise a defect against CR756? Or against Product catalogue?
I do not want to mix this defect here with behavior shown for broadvision products, otherwise will be even more confusing;;;","19/Oct/23 1:20 PM;simon.auch@vodafone.com;Hi Ariadne,
maybe it was not clear what I meant with ""All information until now seems to conflict with the unity case"":
 * We have multiple answers (in this ticket and in other tickets) saying that TECNOTV and TECYESTV control the display of the section (and did so in the past)

 * 
 ** this can't be the case for unity as those are not aligned products
 * In other answers it was mentioned that it is controlled not by TECNOTV and TECYESTV but by categories containing TECNOTV, TECYESTV, 1V1, VP0
 ** sound better, but also all of these products are not aligned and should never have been orderable for unity

In the newly encountered behaviour by Devi (https://jira.sp.vodafone.com/browse/OS-42066?focusedId=2974883&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels:comment-tabpanel#comment-2974883) suddenly the access details are shown. Even though TECNOTV , TECYESTV, VP0, and 1V1 are not bookable according to cable product logic?

Someone has to look into the OSE source code and check _systematically_ when this section is shown. I expect there to be _something_ hardcoded for VFW, but I cannot check that myself.

Without an explanation from OSE side when this section is shown I don't know how else to help with this defect. If it is supposed to be based on the orderability of specific categories {_}then the new behaviour is a OSE contradicts it because no product from that category is orderable in the scenario clicked by me{_}. So for starters this could be analysed and maybe we get some insight which logic we are missing from OSE.  

I would not open another defect for this observation.;;;","23/Oct/23 5:21 PM;ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com;we have agreed that general analysis of CR716 defects regarding installation logic is required.

 This should happen with an valid german IBAN as well, but it is not clear why this was implemented like this and if there was a communication issue or not . If there was, we need clear specifications on how this should work exactly and the different cases so we can implement an appropriate fix.

Hi Harsha,
 
If the KUD product is not part of cable_app_de category then this check will not be shown and the agent is able to continue, otherwise this check will be shown and the agent will not be able to continue
 * In case of telesales, if sepa is true, then this check will be shown and the flow is blocked → agent is not able to continue

For further clarifications, you can check the original story :

https://jira.sp.vodafone.com/browse/OAF-179

OMNIUS : CHCK, As an agent i am allowed to proceed sales flow for cable package with mandatory residence check when SEPA is known, So that Agent can proceed next.;;;","26/Jul/23 10:53 AM;singireddy.reddy@vodafone.com;Will discuss with ari.;;;","15/Aug/23 8:40 PM;ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com;I still do not get it.

The story says: As an agent i am allowed to proceed sales flow for cable package with mandatory residence check when SEPA is known

-> In our example, SEPA Is known - but we are blocked and NOT able to proceed.
-> we are NOT using foreign IBAN

Something is wrong relate to the logic when we do not enter the IBAN itself but bank account and sort code !!
its only allowed for german bank data to use this option to enter bank account and sort code instead of IBAN

Hi Harsha/Ari,

This was clear from the beginning, yes, but as I mentioned, the implementation was intended to be like this :

*In case of telesales, if sepa is true, then this check will be shown and the flow is blocked → agent is not able to continue*

Which means that it does *NOT* matter _what IBAN is used_ , this will be shown if the sepa is true and *If the KUD product is part of cable_app_de category .* 

I agree that the way this is working is not consistent : in one case the agent is able to continue but in another the agent is not able to continue.

The final question is - when should the agent be able to continue the checkout process and when should the agent be blocked? According to the initial documentation the agent should not be able to continue and according to these comments the agent should be able to continue .

What is the purpose of this error message and what was wrongly implemented exactly? We can implement a fix according to these comments but we need to know if the issue is that the whole implementation was not done correctly or not, in order to fix the actual issue and not just a particular case .;;;","17/Aug/23 4:38 PM;ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com;The pop up says its not allowed to continue b{*}ecause of a foreign bank account or/ and different bank account holder{*}.

OAF-179 is NOT relevant here, it might be issue from omnius side.

I will reproduce the issue and attach ConvertandvalidateIBAN logs for 
1) putting the data in bank account and sort code field

2) putting the IBAN directly in IBAN field

Then TechM can compare. For now I reduced the priority as it is only happening for specific cases and can be avoided by using direct IBAN field. 
I will probably not make it before Thursday to attach relevant data, tomorrow is workhop in Campus;;;","05/Sep/23 6:34 PM;bharath.krishnamurthy@vodafone.com;[~ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com]

Thank you;;;","06/Sep/23 2:10 PM;ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com;I have retested the flow once again to product the needed logs (TechM can reproduce easily on its own on ACC2 as well)

Hi Srujana ,

 

Firstly this is not error its feature. Check the below attached details which explains when and how the SEPA validation works. In the above case you can validate the same by getting *GetCablePayerAndPaymentInfo* details.

If you have any queries regarding this could you please schedule a call to conclude on expected behavior or please create new ticket for latest observation.;;;","08/Feb/24 1:37 PM;ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com;[~bharath.krishnamurthy@vodafone.com]  I am sorry but its not about a feature which should work in this way and we are running into circles all the time.

everything was properly explained and understood by Kshitik.

 

Please translate the error message into english! Its an error message that we are not allowed to go ahead because of foreign customer, or different bank account adress.

We are NOT using foreign adress or foreign IBAN here. We are also NOT using different bank account adress. 

We do not want to repeat the discussion again and again, please get in touch in Kshitij

 

You have to use the entry bank account number and sort code to enter it manually, then system is creating IBAN on its own automatically. 

If same IBAN would be typed in directly it works. Its about the functionality of using sort code and bank account number field;;;","12/Feb/24 3:47 PM;atharva.paskanthi@vodafone.com;Hello [~vikash.saurav@vodafone.com] , [~bharath.krishnamurthy@vodafone.com] , Can you please check the latest comment and provide update;;;","13/Feb/24 12:58 PM;atharva.paskanthi@vodafone.com;Comment from [~vikash.saurav@vodafone.com] :

MOM Of yesterdays call:

We had a discussion with Sunil, Bharath and Kshitij

We tried to place the orders in both the ways

i.e with Filling the IBAN directly and also by giving the account number and sort code details 

And we received the same error in both the ways and we checked the response in logs (ValidateIBAN and GetPayerandPaymentInfo ) and observed that customer details are not retrieved in the response as the IBAN provided are invalid IBANS

 

But We have also tried with the Correct German IBANS(Below are the IBANS Used) and still we received the same error (I.e IBAN is not german)

DE10600501010006622066

DE02120300000000202051

DE21200505500001183151,  DE69200505500001083153 (These 2 IBANS has always  worked with KUD Orders previously)

For these 4 IBANS we have checked the Logs (VlaidateIBAN and GetPayerandPaymentInfo ) and we recieved the correct response( i.e Customer details are visible on the Response and also SEPA is showing as true )

Hi [~devi.jampana@vodafone.com]

We have analyzed further and found that there is recent requirement over (https://jira.sp.vodafone.com/browse/OAF-690) [!https://bmcomviva.atlassian.net/images/icons/issuetypes/epic.svg!VFDED1FTS-5531: CR780 - Change of payment validation check for existing SEPA mandatIN DESIGN|https://bmcomviva.atlassian.net/browse/VFDED1FTS-5531] which is now available as part of the software where we are testing the above scenario.

As part the requirement we are now showing NOTIFICATION MODAL and disable ""Weiter"" button of payment section if the scenario we are performing meets below conditions.

System will validate if payment method = ""direct debit""
 * if yes: system will validate if IBAN = DE-IBAN

 ** if yes: system will validate if bank account owner (payer contact) = legal contact

 *** if yes: the system will validate if the bank account owner address (payer address) = legal address

 *** if no: SHOW NOTIFICATION MODAL and disable ""Weiter"" button

 ** if no: SHOW NOTIFICATION MODAL and disable ""Weiter"" button

For the blank data or no PayerAndPaymentInfo response issue +OS-52308+ /VFDEW82E2E-94 is handle via improvement ticket. ref +OAF-744+ VFDED1FTS-5844

 

this the ticket description and comment says issue (open issue is with when agent capture bank details (Bank account number 1241111    Sort Code 70050000)) was fixed with new version of code

Please schedule a meeting to discuss with ACC team. this looks to me 2 issues are mix in one ticket;;;","23/Apr/24 7:29 PM;ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com;[~bharath.krishnamurthy@vodafone.com]  the ticket OS-37304 was raised long time before OS-52308 but as long as OS-52308 is not closed we cannot check further on OS-37304

For this specific scenario still the flow is blocked. its not fixed by CR780/OAF-744 which was deployed today to ACC1

Steps to reproduce

1) Start new order entry for new customer, enter any GERMAN adress
2) Select KUD product from list e.g. Giga TV home Net 
3) proceed to checkout, residence information is displayed (OK)

!image-2024-05-16-14-18-29-777.png|width=1039,height=674!
4) Fill Checkout sections until IBAN section

+*IMPORTANT TO FOLLOW NOW EXACT STEPS*+

5) Click on credit card SYMBOL and enter Sort Code from a German bank institute e.g. 70050000 and any bank account number 

!image-2024-05-16-14-16-28-620.png|width=766,height=490!

6) click on ""Ermitteln"" -> automatically the system creates a valid GERMAN IBAN {color:#de350b}*(IT IS NOT A FOREIGN IBAN)*{color}

!image-2024-05-16-14-17-37-757.png|width=912,height=701!

7) Select Invoice adress and try to proceed -> Error is shown that there is foreign IBAN (WRONG, its GERMAN IBAN) or different invoice adress (WRONG, its not different)

!image-2024-05-16-14-19-58-501.png|width=1008,height=758!

The IBAN is a correct GERMAN IBAN - its just not typed in into the IBAN field but created automatically by the system when entering bank account number and sort code !!

For German IBANs the BIC validation (with OTF-724) should work like for non German IBANs (AS IS). Here Omnius validates BIC without calling IBAN service. 

So actual behavoir is not correct for BIC validation with German IBANs like described by Natasa.

Hi Harsha,
 
What are steps/stack for this issues. Or this is for every stack. plz confirm.;;;","11/May/23 1:16 PM;singireddy.reddy@vodafone.com;Hi Bharat,

We are only interested in cable (Specifically Unitymedia) stack.

After placing an order in Unitymedia region, Once the order is completed Success and the status is reflected in the front end (Omnius), Please take the omnius order ID and search in Order manager and check for customer number (some times it could be Temp_ID or some times there is no customer number at all).

Regards,

Harsha

 ;;;","12/May/23 2:59 PM;bhavesh.renpara1@vodafone.com;Hi,

Ideally permanent account number only can be reflected in Omnius if OGW sends to us.

*I1010 - UpdateTemporaryCustomerID:​*
# This service pushes permanent customer ID from OGW to OSE.​
# OGW pushes message to amdocs.ogw.customerupdate queue.​
# I1010 service pulls message from this queue and puts in dyna.ose.setstatus queue.​
# status daemon pulls message from dyna.ose.setstatus queue and updates in table “catalog_package”->parent_account_number

So check and share the below logs to check if first OGW has sent permanent account number.
- OIL archive logs for service I1010. For the day when the permanent account number was pushed by OGW. 
- Status daemons logs to check further if received account number was  update.

[~bharath.krishnamurthy@vodafone.com] As far as i know process(mentioned above) for updating permanent account number at our end should same for Unity media as well. But you can double check with our BA.

As per my discussion with Rohan and Mattias, Rene and Tobias gonna check back if there is any such requirement on OGW to send the updated customerID to Omnius via ReplaceRempCustID message and raise a CR based on the need.

So, this cannot be a defect on OGW and need to be cancelled.

""Just to make the example of CUSTOMERID to be clear. Let’s use the following UM (test) data: legacy Customer-ID as 109235205 from the NRW region.

Based on the mapping defined in the confluence page, the CUSTOMERID is formatted as CUMST.UMREGION (region decode: 1= NRW ; 2= HSN ; 3= KBW) + CUMST.CUCNO (legacy Customer-ID).

So the CUSTOMERID identifier in MRT will have the value: {*}{color:#FF0000}1{color}{*}109235205 .""

Migration team can be helpful here. MRT is designed in discussion with them and Legacy Ids are maintained the way it is agreed upon.

As far as i know, at Customer service desk, UM Customer is always asked the Region/state they come from. This is asked due to the fact that the same identifier can be present in 3 regions and it is important to distinguish the actual customer record.;;;","23/Jan/23 10:19 PM;ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com;if you need more details how index search for unity is implemented you can get in touch with  [~thomas.schneider1@vodafone.com]

ali;;;","15/Dec/22 8:01 PM;heike.eisenlohr1@vodafone.com;I think this bug was created when we did not receive any status updates due to some misconfiguration in the weborder DB. We fixed that configuration issue on Nov 8 (WeborderDBRelease 2190.2022.11.00.03). 
Since then it should work, also for manually approved orders since the weborder ID should be sufficient to get an order status.
Does the error still occur? If yes, do you have example orders? ;;;","16/Dec/22 2:06 PM;ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com;as per latest Discussion with Daniel, the customer ID is relevant to get the status. But for manual approved orders the customer id is not available in a short time. But if helpful we can create another order.... it would be great if issue is solved, because it is there since months.
At the same time we received order status completed for all orders which got auto approved.

 

[~singireddy.reddy@vodafone.com]  can you please create a new customer order on ACC1 for unitymedia which would force manual approval?

Created 2 orders that went into manual.
We got them approved, one as a new customer order, one as an existing customer order. (this doesn't change the status, it remains open)
We got them closed (this changes the status)
The status closed was picked up by the UOTracker and is also visible from OSF (This means that we didn't find a bug)

Our current best guess from looking at the screenshots is that: in that case the order was only approved and not closed and as such the order status didn't change, so there was nothing to show in OSF.;;;","11/May/23 4:47 PM;ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com;[~singireddy.reddy@vodafone.com]  can you please run one test case again on ACC1 with manual approval?

can you please check it with Cable?;;;","27/Oct/23 5:45 PM;ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com;I have the feeling we are running around in circles here.

Very long time ago I already mentioned that I assume we are not getting back the real customer ID and therefore we do not get the status completed

!image-2023-10-27-14-14-19-815.png!

 

1) in case the order is auto approved, we immediately get back the customer ID from unity backend, and it works fine

2) in case the order is manual approved after some time, somehow a second ""update"" is missing, which would return the customer ID 

But through all the discussions it was stated it should not be a problem in this area. I still feel that this gap is somewhere in this process.

Maybe we should have a call with all relevant parties -> OGW and VKD Gateway team ;;;","15/Nov/23 2:57 PM;devi.jampana@vodafone.com;Hi [~ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com] [~ran.farjun1@vodafone.com]

Yes for the Manual orders , success status is not reached in Telesales

Retail orders are working fine

As in defect steps it was mentioned retail, we tried placing orders with Retail

Changing the defect description to avoid further confusion

 

Regards

Srujana;;;","27/Nov/23 2:21 PM;ran.farjun1@vodafone.com;Hi,

so after the meeting today we agree that we need to check with Cable why OGW is not getting customer id in any of the set order status.
this is the reason why oneDMS call is failing.;;;","27/Nov/23 4:28 PM;ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com;The discussion in the beginning of this defect and my understanding all the time:

In case order is auto approved, customer ID is immediately given back to VKD Gateway
In Case order is NOT auto approved but later manually, there is no new call to get the customer ID -> thats why its not available

But in between it was mentioned that this is not the issue - as its working for retail, its strange that not working for Telesales.

Please note that OneDMS is handling Telesales Unity like VKD for Contract Summary Archiving. Not sure if relevant.

2. Nina Pickl, Vodafone will discuss with Ari regarding Temp Id.;;;","30/Nov/23 11:01 AM;devi.jampana@vodafone.com;Hi ,

Outcome of yesterday call:

After investigation with Nina and Rohan , 

We got the information that for Auto approval orders we can see the customer number and Unified Order ID ,so success status is reflecting in OSF

But for Manual approval orders, Customer id is not available in logs and also Unified Order ID is missing and Action is getting skipped

Because of this issue , OGW is not sending the success status

We have to check on this issue with Unity BackEnd Developer

Will keep the updates posted

Thank you all for joining the call!!
 
Please find the final Action points below from our call today:

Action Point:

;;;","07/Dec/23 1:51 PM;nina.pickl@vodafone.com;Updates:

 

OGW needs the customer number in case Unity Manual Approval Orders in Telesales and Retails, which should be provided from VKD to OGW within the existing FulfillmentStarted Request.

 

The customer number is atm provided only for Auto Approval Orders, but missing for Manual Approval orders, therefore the document cannot be archived and the OGW processing remain in status pending (the VKD status is SUCCESS but the orders don't get Sucecss status in OSF Fronend):

An error was encountered while invoking ScanView-SaveDocument WS. Details [Error_Code: HTTPOutbound_0001, Error_Message: Received a fault from processing server for service '/ScanView-001/SaveDocument': An invalid number format or number value was encountered.

Note: Retail Manual Approval Orders don't have this issue because the call to oneDMS/Customernumber is not needed for the E2E flow. They get the Status Success.

 

As the customer number has not been sent for Manual Approval Order until now, a new PST change is required.

I will take the topic with me and check if we can request this change at the PST CAT train, Team Ash(Benjamin Sachse) or Nora.

 

The new requirement should contain following information:
 * no difference between retail and telesales from cable perspective
 * example set status messages received by OSF
 * fulfilment started from manual approval 
 * fulfilment started from automatic approval 


 * explanation on
 * what you clicked to create the manual approval order
 * how to approve the manual approval order

Previously when the order worked ,it was in TEST1B

After it was changed to TEST3B 

May be the changes were not there in TEST3B?(Just a doubt)

 

Regards

Srujana;;;","23/Jan/24 6:49 PM;simon.auch@vodafone.com;The test3b and test1b should both have sufficiently new versions deployed with the changes.

Some time ago you had a retest where a manual approval order was updated to status completed in OSF, could you also provide the logs for that order?

 ;;;","26/Jan/24 3:19 PM;ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com;I do not think that we can get these old logs anymore, not sure if we had restarts of servers in between.

Lets do one thing:

1) one retest on ACC1 test2b
2) one retest on ACC2 test3b

As far as I understood from Simon, solution should be present on both cable backends

[~simon.auch@vodafone.com] 

Elango performed the same flow on the both environments ACC1/test2b and ACC2/test3b- on ACC2/test3b worked fine, but not on ACC1/test2b.

Can you please check if the fix is available on test2b or what can be the reason otherwise?

 ;;;","01/Feb/24 4:26 PM;simon.auch@vodafone.com;So, the obvious difference between test3b (working) and test2b (not working) is that on test3b the status update is a `COMPLETED_SUCCESS` while on the test2b it is a `IN_PROGRESS_FULFILLMENT_STARTED`.

It can be seen that the unity order tracker on the test2b does not trigger any more updates for the order after the one with the status OPEN (for which we already have a customer ID as seen in the log).

I checked the test2b database contains the UME_ORDER_STATUS 'COMPLETED', which is correct, but apparently not written by the unity order tracker. Maybe there is a race condition between the unity order tracker and some other service that tries to write this field? This would also explain why it only happens sometimes.;;;","01/Feb/24 4:47 PM;nina.pickl@vodafone.com;[~elango.durairaj@vodafone.com]  Can you please check if the test2b order was successfully approved AND closed in Unity Backend?

 

Thanks [~simon.auch@vodafone.com] 

Was it not agreed/ implemented, that the customer number should be transferred in fullfilment started status?

That's why a change is needed that the customer number is transferred to OGW in the *fulfilment started status* message from VKD.;;;","01/Feb/24 5:19 PM;elango.durairaj@vodafone.com;[~nina.pickl@vodafone.com]  785791 ACC1 , test2b,  order was successfully completed in unity backend without any issue.

 * As expected we still see some updates that are created by an artifact that is not supposed to track unity orders:
{code:java}
Mar 15 07:14:58 vltn456 z3-test1b-app-jupiter FTM#2350.2024.03.00.00 42254613 INFO    core_1  core_1 43ea73qagerpjvtk430ft7imae de.kabeldeutschland.jupiter.core.vkd.VkdEventsProcessor - VkdGateway order status update success.

Response: OrderStatusResponse{httpCode=200, webOrderId=8057461, takenAction=SUCCESS - passed status to remote service} {code}
Which in turn still results in some updates send to OSF that are missing the customer id:
{code:json}
posted orderStatus {
  ""unifiedOrderId"" : ""1780729"",
  ""webOrderId"" : 8057461,
  ""orderStatus"" : ""IN_PROGRESS_FULFILLMENT_STARTED"",
  ""creationDate"" : ""2024-03-15T07:19:27.920"",
  ""statusInfos"" : [
    {
      ""statusType"" : ""EVENT_DETAIL"",
      ""system"" : ""cable"",
      ""eventCode"" : ""OTHER"",
      ""eventPresentationText"" : ""OTHER"",
      ""eventValue"" : ""OTHER""
    }
  ]
}
{code}

 * The update by the unity order tracker however did work and was also successfully published to OSF:
{code:json}
posted orderStatus {
  ""unifiedOrderId"" : ""1780729"",
  ""webOrderId"" : 8057461,
  ""orderStatus"" : ""COMPLETED_SUCCESS"",

      ""eventValue"" : ""543070901""
    }
  ]
}
{code}

My assumption right now is, that the ""lost"" updates before where due to the environment issues on VFW side and we actually only have the issue of updates that are send by another VKD system that are not supposed to be sent for VFW orders.;;;","27/Mar/24 4:08 PM;ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com;[~simon.auch@vodafone.com]  I am not really sure if I understand your comment correctly.

The ""lost"" updates most likely were due to the environment issues on VFW side, or at least we cannot reproduce them anymore since they have been fixed.
The problematic updates sent to OSF by other cable systems that are missing the customer ID, should not happen anymore.

There is currently no way I can help with this issue on the test2b nor any way how I can tell you when it will be fixed as this is up to unity colleagues.;;;","10/Jun/24 12:41 PM;elango.durairaj@vodafone.com;[@Asmitha Gayam, Vodafone (External)|mailto:Asmitha.Gayam@Vodafone.com], Below mentioned order approved manually from my end and not auto approved,

if incase this order also not success then i will arrange a call to sort out this issue as priority, thanks in advance for all your cooperation's for this fix.;;;","27/Jun/24 4:02 PM;simon.auch@vodafone.com;The problem is still the same as before:
We do not get an updated order state from unity.
The pending order state we get from unity is still ""APPR"" and no order state can be retrieved from unity.
This can also be checked by trying it out in the swagger ui of minerva adapter: [https://z3-test1b-app-wss-orderaut-lb.kabeldeutschland.de/MinervaAdapterService/swagger-ui/index.html#/OrdersController/orderStatusByWeborderId]

Searching for the order status results in:
{code:json}
{
  ""httpCode"": 500,
  ""messageIdentifier"": ""GENERIC_ERROR"",
  ""message"": ""500 Server Error: \""{<EOL>  \""errors\"": [<EOL>    {<EOL>      \""code\"": \""QUERY_EXECUTION\"",<EOL>      \""message\"": \""[SQL0204] SPPORDERX in ANYPOINT type *FILE not found.\""<EOL>    }<EOL>  ]<EOL>}\"""",

      ""type"": ""ERROR""
    }
  ],
  ""retriable"": true
}
{code}
Searching for the pending order state results in:
{code:json}
{
  ""customerNumber"": 1012597301,
  ""externalOrderReference"": ""8271657"",
  ""pendingOrderStatus"": ""APPR"",
  ""cancellationReason"": ""UNKNOWN""
}
{code}

Edit: 
I'm not sure this is currently exactly the same issue as before as also successful orders cannot be found by the endpoint. Independent of this, however it is still an issue that can only be solved by unity.
There is currently no way I can further help with this topic as the issue is (according to my analysis) on unity side and I do not have access to it. Also notice that I already shared all unity contacts I have, to further progress with this topic please arrange a meeting with them. Feel free to invite me to the meeting.
