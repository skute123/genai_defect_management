Following a summary on what has happened:

In the morning, we received a defect related to an intermittent issue occurring in E2E stage.
One of the Routers/MP nodes was causing majority of “message = Unable to identify proxy for host” errors.
This was hindering System Demo as they received 404 Errors as an outcome of the behavior.
Even after rolling back the platform with DLM back up the issue persisted.
When checking the filesystem on Router/MP2 one could see that the mounting was not there anymore
The Patching process was restarting the nodes, since some of the packages updated were Kernel related.
The Restart dropped the mount point since they were to put to fstab and therefore not persistent.
The Patching made a miss during AMI rotation transparent.",,Solstice,Legacy,ACC,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Green,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"0|icr0sr:",9223372036854775807,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Backlog - UNCOVERED,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Application Configuration,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Vodafone -> Solstice,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"30/Jul/25 8:41 PM;pallavi.kokate1@vodafone.com;SolDefect is raised :[[SOLDEFECT-18543] OSF | Wave 10.0.1 | ACC3 | Fusion C new activation orders are failing with error : [HTTPAdaptor] Cannot connect to HTTP Server[api-test-asgw-solstice.rat-hub.citt.connect-vf.de:-1], Status[404], Message [{\""fault\"":{\""faultstring\"":\ - DE Jira|https://de.jira.agile.vodafone.com/browse/SOLDEFECT-18543];;;","31/Jul/25 6:52 PM;pranjali.shetake@vodafone.com;We have retested the defect and issue is resolved now.

hi [~pranjali.shetake@vodafone.com] 
I checked the logs and see that for cable packages we have some cable phar backend connectivity issue which resulted on 503 on OSE.

But for mobile packages it can be intermittent issue due to cache build activity. So immediately after clear cache we access system then cache build will take time and result on 503.

If issue still persist lets connect and observe logs by performing problematic flow

Hi [~pallavi.kokate1@vodafone.com], [~puranik.shailesh@vodafone.com] 

The request which is coming to SOI is triggered from OSF. 

In the given trace id, I can see that OSF is not sending the ""AddressID"": ""151xxxx"" for billing address (in shopping cart), which is why the flow is failing.

Please check this with front end teams.;;;","22/Aug/25 11:52 AM;gaurav.lanjewar1@vodafone.com;Hi [~bharath.krishnamurthy@vodafone.com] kindly share your input for this issue.;;;","22/Aug/25 1:38 PM;shival.gupta1@vodafone.com;Hi [~tanvi.bagade@vodafone.com] [~gaurav.lanjewar1@vodafone.com]

Hi [~pallavi.kokate1@vodafone.com] ,

Based on description I can see no fulfillment logs generated means something is stuck within OSE looks while processing fulfilment xml.

Kindly arrange call as we can recreate scenario.

We need to check on ACC3 what's wrong is there any logging enabled or response from backend systems are slow.

{{{}acc3 docroot{}}}/var/log/services/Vfde_Customer → collect the RetrieveCustomerInfo logs for the problematic customer. We need to look for logs on both web servers of ACC3 env.

Hi Pallavi,

 

As confirmed by the reporter, on teams group chat conversation both the switches (VF-ID and Error Handling) are ON.

Response logs attached with the ticket show that the *“HTTP Status Code is 200”* and the status value is *“VALID”* in the response. In reference to OS-23334, if HTTP Code is 200 and Status is VALID, then it's Category0 (successful scenario), and therefore, Omnius will not show any error message.

Hi Pallavi,

As mentioned in [OS-60493] OMNIUS_CHCK_As Omnius, I do not want to trigger the DXL(digitalIdentity) service call used for retrieval of VFID and will not populate VFID in FusionC SubmitOrder request so that VFID creation request can be triggered by OGW(OS-60493) - Vodafone Global Jira

The Digital Identity API service will not be triggered by Omnius if the switch is ON. This is expected behavior.;;;","14/Jul/25 5:14 PM;pallavi.kokate1@vodafone.com;Issue is not from OSE side or DXL side then we will retest this issue again once this issue resolved OS-75006;;;","15/Jul/25 3:24 PM;pallavi.kokate1@vodafone.com;Still with duplicate address its not working;;;","15/Jul/25 4:48 PM;daniel.loos@vodafone.com;Regarding this comment:

Hi Pallavi,

As mentioned in OS-60493 OMNIUS_CHCK_As Omnius, I do not want to trigger the DXL(digitalIdentity) service call used for retrieval of VFID and will not populate VFID in FusionC SubmitOrder request so that VFID creation request can be triggered by OGW(OS-60493) - Vodafone Global Jira

The Digital Identity API service will not be triggered by Omnius if the switch is ON. This is expected behavior.

-> are you saying that when the ""error handling switch"" is enabled, we do not perform any error handling because anything behind DigitalIdentity will not be called in the first place?
If so, could you confirm this please with [~gerd.angress@vodafone.com], [~philipp.roeper1@vodafone.com] ?;;;","15/Jul/25 11:24 PM;philipp.roeper1@vodafone.com;Hi All,

let's please clarify the current situation of this defect here, so everyone is on the same page.

1) *Issue:* FE validation is not displaying an error message, when we enter a duplicate e-mail address.

2) *Business requirement:* Agent should be prevented from proceeding through checkout once an e-mail is validated as duplicate. 

3) *Current ACC 3 settings* (as of monday 14th of July): 
-> OS-12220 Switch = ON
-> OS-28388 Omnius Switch = ON
-> OS-28388 OGW Switch = ON

4) *Clarifications / Comments*

[~bharath.krishnamurthy@vodafone.com] We have 2 comments from Shival here.
1. ""{color:#de350b}In reference to OS-23334, if HTTP Code is 200 and Status is VALID, then it's Category0 (successful scenario), and therefore, Omnius will not show any error message.{color}"" 
-> That should be the case if it passes validation and not if it's a duplicate e-mail

2. ""{color:#de350b}As mentioned in (OS-60493). The Digital Identity API service will not be triggered by Omnius if the switch is ON. This is expected behavior.{color}""
-> This story and also OS-25316 (which is mentioned as the initial implementation) are both referring to the submission/fulfillment behaviour. From my point of view this issue is not about the fulfilment and process/submit order part. Its about not getting the correct validation which should prevent the processing at all.

[~raniero.calzavara@vodafone.com] mentioned at the very beginning that either e-mail is not unique or we have some wrong configuration regarding DXL environment.

[~pallavi.kokate1@vodafone.com]
-> Our current test execution for 10.0.1 is showing the related test case on {*}{color:#00875a}passed{color}{*}. (OS-73358)
-> You expected that [OS-75006] OSF | Wave 10.0.1 | ACC3 | ValidateDxlContactMediumVerification is failing with status code: 500 Internal Server Error - Vodafone Global Jira had an impact on this current issue but it didn't solve the problem.

5) *Action points*

[~pallavi.kokate1@vodafone.com] 
1. Could you please verify my mentioned points from above if I misunderstood something?
2. Are you definitely using a duplicate e-mail which exists on MINT side? If yes, then something has changed on ACC3 or DXL side in case that was working before as our test execution is reflecting. 

[~bharath.krishnamurthy@vodafone.com] / [~shival.gupta1@vodafone.com] 
1. Please also take a look at my comments above, so that we are on the same starting point to find a solution.

 

Thank you in advance to shed some light on the dark bug side :).

Hi Tanvi/Ari ,

 

_*""Request 'configurator/cart/getRules' failed with status code: 503 Backend fetch failed"" error while performing new activation for Cable orders*_ can be issue with cable phar file version or the cable external service connectivity issue as OSE is not processing cable rules. One suspect we had the day issue occurred was PHAR got replaced after rollback of full build but this was already confirmed by Pramod PHAR file not updated/changed when they did redeployment of full build. So PHAR is same and may be 503 issue is intermittent sue to some other reasons.

If its observed after every deployment then we need to check with TID team on logs, to identify the reasons for 503 based on error/exception logs;;;","18/Jul/25 5:37 PM;tanvi.bagade@vodafone.com;Hi all, after deployment, 503 Backend fetch failed error is not being observed. PFB screenshot -->

Hello TID team,

As we are not able to reproduce, we need to find which activities are changing the file permissions of config.xml and local.xml

For the mentioned Omnius Order Id: 473533, Submit Order logs is populated with correct date format 2025-07-15 as expected.

 OIL to OGW is sending as per interface specification. Same format is used for FixedNet/DSL and it was agreed during design that we have to use same format for FucsionC as well.

Hi Krishnkumar/Pallavi/Ajay,

 

No, It is not because of PCAT as PCAT has no data related to Future Activation Date. Future Activation Data retrieved from C1- Interface, and it is implemented in a way that if something goes wrong with interface or correct response not received from C1, then OSE disable the Future activation date section. ;;;",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Hi Tanvi,

FusionC TV and its functionalities are introduced in OS-50250

https://jira.sp.vodafone.com/browse/OS-50250

which covers the enabling/disabling of FusionC TV option, permission control etc. Since the Epic Switch is OFF, these functionalities are not visible. It is not an defect.

Hi [~tanvi.bagade@vodafone.com] 

Same php8 code working fine on acc1 so should be fine on ACC3 if we have s/w version compatible with cable phar version. May be schedule call and first observe what is the error and then we can decide. Looks to me phar file is incorrect or s/w version which is not compatible with PHAR file on acc3

Hi Atharva/Daniel,

 

CR895 ([!https://bmcomviva.atlassian.net/images/icons/issuetypes/story.svg!VFDED2W100S-120: CR895-OMNIUS_CHCK_As Omnius, I want to integrate with the new DXL(emailValidation) service so that customer email can be validated to generate the VFID (OS-66548)Done|https://bmcomviva.atlassian.net/browse/VFDED2W100S-120] )is delivered with the updated endpoint and request body. In the logs, it looks like the old endpoint is in use.

Could you please check and confirm the correct endpoint configuration and what exactly is expected from Omnius.;;;","06/Jun/25 4:21 PM;atharva.paskanthi@vodafone.com;TechM suggested to Schedule a call with Gerd, Shival and Srikrushna.. will check availability and plan;;;","06/Jun/25 4:27 PM;shival.gupta1@vodafone.com;[~daniel.loos@vodafone.com] [~gerd.angress@vodafone.com] 

CR895 (OS-66548) is delivered with the changes over OS-12220 Epic (Changes on OS-27752 Story). CR895 doesn't have switch to roll back the changes. With CR895 changes, new endpoint and request body to be used. To switch off CR895, we have to switch off OS-12220.

To use request body from technical story OS-27752 and to synchronize CR895 - OS-28388, we need to do changes in the code and move CR895 from OS-12220 to OS-28388.

 ;;;","06/Jun/25 5:48 PM;ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com;Discussed with Gerd to try the following setup in test (again)

Error handling OFF but new endpoints set to be able to handle the new request body;;;","07/Jun/25 11:57 AM;ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com;[~atharva.paskanthi@vodafone.com]  [~tanvi.bagade@vodafone.com]  
For now we have switched again to the new endpoint on ACC1 - it should now accept the request

Please retrigger one order and check if unblocked now. 

This might be workaround only.

;;;","09/Jun/25 4:30 PM;ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com;[~atharva.paskanthi@vodafone.com]  yes please leave defect open we have to discuss further with [~philipp.roeper1@vodafone.com]  and [~daniel.loos@vodafone.com]  how to handle and if any further checks are required

Therefore its still assigned to vendor TechM, as TechM missed to give switch off for CR895 and maybe we need better solution from them;;;","10/Jun/25 2:28 PM;ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com;Summarized setting and test result via email and informed Wave 10 release manager about workaround, in case no one has any restrictions we can go ahead with this workaround;;;","10/Jun/25 8:25 PM;ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com;With this workaround, we are able to keep VF-ID/Mint integration live – OS -12220 

Impact 
 # Duplicate Emails -> will not blocked, because VF-ID is working only on the code “200” and not on the status  
 # Invalid Emails -> will not blocked, because VF-ID is working only on the code “200” and not on the status  

In both scenarios we will create a VF-ID after the customer has confirmed the CS. 
For the first one Omnius will run in an error (see [OS-23802|https://eur03.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fjira.sp.vodafone.com%2Fbrowse%2FOS-23802&data=05%7C02%7CAriadne.Thun1%40vodafone.com%7C53d99bb8392445a783fa08dda82d1344%7C68283f3b84874c86adb3a5228f18b893%7C0%7C0%7C638851633966437907%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJFbXB0eU1hcGkiOnRydWUsIlYiOiIwLjAuMDAwMCIsIlAiOiJXaW4zMiIsIkFOIjoiTWFpbCIsIldUIjoyfQ%3D%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&sdata=iOGREaLqo8PaBe3M2KN7EaISMu4B2WrVY67epTwQQQE%3D&reserved=0] ) and we will start the fulfillment without providing a VF-ID.

For the second one we will create a VF-ID for an email-address which is not allowed formally and might not run in an error by creation a VF-ID.

Both scenarios will be covered end of August with the error-handling epic.

Today customer are activated in KIAS .

Please find below test data:

 

119046729;;;","18/Jun/25 12:19 PM;rohan.kumbhar@vodafone.com;As per yesterday's call we had the below things which were done and tried to investigate the scenarios
1.  Defect was retested by testing team and issue was reproduced
2. Amdocs DBA analyzed and debugged the issue where SQL queries were checked and as per DBA they did not identified any issue in SQL statement checks
3. Post Amdocs Dev Analysis it was identified that issue might be due to Media type where only Media type = NT was accepted by the Activation Daemon but media type PA was rejected and what we observed was that the orders from KIAS test team which were directly placed by CSM team had Media type NT but the orders which were placed from OSF had media type PA.
4. Post the above analysis KIAS dev and VF team decided to provide a new Binary file for extra logs debugging which was placed locally in the VF server bin directory and then KIAS was restarted.
5. New flow was triggered and it worked -- but this doesn't seem to be a permanent fix as temporary the orders are flowing and passed but this issue can still occur and not yet fully resolved 

Please do find the overall comments and analysis from Amdocs and VF 
In the last call I was with Andreas Knocke(VF) and Christina(VF) and we agreed that Amdocs check whether there is any dependency on Media Category and Andreas(VF) will approach the OCI Oracle team again. 
As per Amdocs result: There is NO dependency. 
 
In the call with the DBAs yesterday, testers ran the flow but DBAs were not able to see any session. 
The problem seems to be a synchronization issue between the nodes of the distributed database in OCI. This can only be resolved by Vodafone, by the team that managers the OCI cloud DBs. 
 ;;;","20/Jun/25 11:26 AM;ajay.yashwantbhavar@vodafone.com;Issue still persists, Victor, Christina, Mirel and Andreas will check this issue today.;;;","20/Jun/25 2:30 PM;ajay.yashwantbhavar@vodafone.com;*This issue is Resolved. No changes done from KIAS side, KIAS Team is checking on RCA.*

As we are not having any fix for it, we test in switch OFF mode first, as this epic will have a technical go live only.

 

For the test cases which are not E2E, currently we are unable to perform it because Error Handling switch is disabled in BackOffice.  We will discuss a time period to activate it again, during the current wave test. Then we will perform scenarios which are not E2E
