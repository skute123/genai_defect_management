"OSF | Wave 8.2 | ACC1 KUD standalone products blocked in checkout after IBAN validation",OS-52308,3177091,Bug,Closed,OS,"OSF wave4, wave 5 ..",software,matthias.breuer1@vodafone.com,,,1-Blocker,Fixed,akash.ubbu@vodafone.com,ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com,ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com,22/Feb/24 10:57 PM,11/Jul/24 5:30 PM,07/Oct/25 1:11 PM,11/Jul/24 5:29 PM,,Wave 8.1.5,Wave 8.2,Wave 8.2.1,Wave 8.2.2,,,,,,,Checkout,,,,,,,,,"Currently KUD TV products for Unitymedia as well as for VKD cannot be booked, as failing in checkout with error message after IBAN Validation.

Steps to reproduce for Telesales channel:

1) Enter unitymedia or VKD adress -> new customer
2) Add KUD product e.g. GigaTV Net, 1.{-}6. Monat 0,{-}€
3) move to checkout, fill in customer details > customer adress in Germany
4) reach to IBAN section, type in GERMAN IBAN e.g. DE20700500000003658888 (Any German IBAN can be taken!)
->IBAN validation is running and successfull
5) Select invoice adress as customer adress and do NOT select any different bank account holder
6) Klick on ""weiter"" and get error message

_{color:#ff0000}Die ausgewählten kabel-unabhängigen Produkte (z.B. GigaTV App und Net) lassen seit dem 01.04.2018 eine Nutzung innerhalb der gesamten EU zu. Aber nach gesetzlichen Vorgaben nur von Kunden mit festem Wohnsitz in Deutschland.){color}_

_{color:#ff0000}Die Prüfung der Bankverbindung hat ergeben, dass eine ausländische Bankverbindung oder ein abweichender Kontoinhaber angegeben wurden.{color}_

_{color:#ff0000}Leider kann aus diesen Gründen die Prüfung auf festen Wohnsitz in Deutschland nur über den nächsten Vodafone-Shop erfolgen. Bringen Sie hierzu Ihren Personalausweis oder eine Meldebescheinigung mit.{color}_

 

We are not using foreign customer adress or foreign IBAN, and also +*not*+ using foreign invoice adress or different bank account holder
It is not the problem, that its going to be validated if there is any data from foreign countries used! The validation itself is correct process - but the result is wrong! It has to be identified by the system, that this customer is allowed to pay the products so we are able to move to the next section.

 

It seems the booking works sometimes, and sometimes not. Or maybe only for specific constellation of KUD products it works. We need to investigate if there is an issue with the software or not

 

*Positive* examples from this morning:

Hi [~natasa.dimovic1@vodafone.com]  [~ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com] ,

We have analyzed further and found that there is recent requirement over (https://jira.sp.vodafone.com/browse/OAF-690) [!https://bmcomviva.atlassian.net/images/icons/issuetypes/epic.svg!VFDED1FTS-5531: CR780 - Change of payment validation check for existing SEPA mandatIN DESIGN|https://bmcomviva.atlassian.net/browse/VFDED1FTS-5531] which is now available as part of the software where we are testing the above scenario.

As part the requirement we are now showing NOTIFICATION MODAL and disable ""Weiter"" button of payment section if the scenario we are performing meets below conditions.

System will validate if payment method = ""direct debit""
 * if yes: system will validate if IBAN = DE-IBAN

 ** if yes: system will validate if bank account owner (payer contact) = legal contact

 *** if yes: the system will validate if the bank account owner address (payer address) = legal address

 **** if yes: the system switches to the next checkout section

 **** if no: SHOW NOTIFICATION MODAL and disable ""Weiter"" button

 *** if no: SHOW NOTIFICATION MODAL and disable ""Weiter"" button

 ** if no: SHOW NOTIFICATION MODAL and disable ""Weiter"" button

 * if no: SHOW NOTIFICATION MODAL and disable ""Weiter"" button.;;;","23/Feb/24 2:49 PM;ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com;[~vikash.saurav@vodafone.com]  but for our use case:

-> Its valid DE IBAN

-> Its payer adress = legal adress

ALL are YES -> so no window should be shown.

So you are not getting some of the information back from PCAT side? This Contact is missing? Or what is missing value?

Hi [~ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com] ,

Technically we have only these additional validation

Hi Ari,
 

As per the CR780 we are checking below conditions

Technically we have only these additional validation
 * KUD(Cable Independent package with product in category CABLE->giga_app_de) in cart

 * Its valid DE IBAN

 * Its bank account owner = legal contact

 * Its payer address = legal address

If all conditions meet then agent is allowed to continue.

 
*Customer legal contact & legal address* is what we capture or prefill on customer section of checkout

!b117ed88-4bda-47a3-8750-9f38f445a52f.png!

*Bank account owner (payer contact) & Bank account owner address (payer address)* is what we receive as part of *GetPayerAndPaymentInfoResponse* which is {{I1004_GetPayerAndPaymentInfo}} service response we are expected to receive for Cable packages in addition to {{I04_ConvertAndValidateIBAN}} *.*

*!468b5eec-eef3-4ba2-9939-4efeb1a62c8b.png!*

*Here in this scenario one of the condition is getting failed based on the check mentioned on CR780*
 * Its bank account owner = legal contact

 * Its payer address = legal address;;;","27/Feb/24 6:17 PM;ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com;[~vikash.saurav@vodafone.com] I think there is some logical error in the scenario.

1) if the IBAN is already existing in cable backend, it might be possible to give back information about the payer (CR780)

2) if its NEW IBAN, like here - how should cable backend know something about this payer? Its not existing in backend yet, will just be created with this new order - so the response has to be with empty data;;;","01/Mar/24 12:53 PM;gaurav.lanjewar1@vodafone.com;Hi [~bharath.krishnamurthy@vodafone.com]  Do we have any update on this.

Hi Ari,

After Yesterday call on  4-3-2024, with VF team and BA Thorsten

Conclusion of the call: user story improvement will be created by BA Kshitij.;;;","05/Mar/24 2:29 PM;ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com;We have discussed yesterday with Kshitij -> the actual requirement of CR780 was to compare data in the checkout itself, and not use any data from the cable backend for it. This was not concrete enough described in the requirement itself. 

When calling cable backend for unknown IBANS it cannot give any data back, and therefore the flow is blocked, as data entered in frontend is not matching to data coming back from cable backend (as its empty).

Improvement is required to change the flow - until this time the defect has to be on hold. As its blocking KUD only flow completely, it has to be changed as fast as possible (its present in production already as well)

rollback of CR780 is not possible ;;;","14/Mar/24 5:33 PM;ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com;[~vikash.saurav@vodafone.com]  is there any update on the improvement story we have discussed about in the call with Kshitij and [~thorsten.lehnert@vodafone.com] ?;;;","18/Mar/24 12:19 PM;gaurav.lanjewar1@vodafone.com;Hi [~vikash.saurav@vodafone.com]  is kshitij available today?  Can you ask him to share his input.;;;","20/Mar/24 7:33 PM;gaurav.lanjewar1@vodafone.com;Update from Kshitij :

By looking at the OA1 logs currently real-time archiving seems to be working fine in PR, as also confirmed by Lac in below mail from DB tables.
 
@Ariadne Thun, Vodafone, Could you please brief the issue you facing due to real-time archiving?
 
@DL_VOIS-VF-DE-AT-TEMS_Team@vodafone.com, 
To de-activate this real-time archiving , we have to set below parameter to false in OM core instances and shut down the OA1(goindr) instance.
File : om-core-env.properties
Parameter: om-core.onedms.archive.active=true
Kindly raise CCR to change the configuration, in case if real time archiving needs to be shut down.
 
CCR - Z_SRT02376962A is raised to make the required changes at PR OM.

Please let us know once changes will be done.

It looks like that there is a similar problem on PR between system ETOP and SBus:
There are also delays (up to 100 sec) for synchronous messages sent by ETOP to SBus. 

The problem exists more than a week, a PN was created yesterday PN (SPN-ASB-000141483) by project team.
The UAT for ETOP is stopped now

Due to high load we have restarted SBUS application with MQ. After restart we checked and found load is decreased somehow but again it increasing.

We have checked from DB and user end no long running sessions there.

So we have raised SRT (Z_SRT02373646A || INC000083362457) to HP-UX team to check long running session.

the different is that we didnt use OIL as the client.

because of this case and the error: Error message when trying to connect to OIL server,  Connection reset by peer.

It looks like that there is a similar problem on PR between system ETOP and SBus:
There are also delays (up to 100 sec) for synchronous messages sent by ETOP to SBus. 

The problem exists more than a week, a PN was created yesterday PN (SPN-ASB-000141483) by project team.
The UAT for ETOP is stopped now

	Could you pls check this problem and take it into account, it looks similar the the VFP-SBus problem!?
;;;","27/Dec/23 12:59 PM;rohan.kumbhar@vodafone.com;We have checked and found in PRSBUS server asocr01 is high load due to this we are facing timeout error.

Due to high load we have restarted SBUS application with MQ. After restart we checked and found load is decreased somehow but again it increasing.

We have checked from DB and user end no long running sessions there.

So we have raised SRT (Z_SRT02373646A || INC000083362457) to HP-UX team to check long running session.

Solution Category : AWS LB Issue

As per the latest update from Patrick, the AWS load balancer is not able to access so the clients cannot send requests.
AWS team have addressed this to GKS to check and hope they will find the issue ASAP.


After the AWS LB issue is fixed, we can see the order is moved ahead from 1215 CREATE_MASTER_DATA in ITEFFONLDB.


So we have asked tester to retest from there side, as per testers confirmation issue is resolved.

*Comments:*

12/1/2023 8:53:57 PM pooja.mote TEMS_FN_PUNE
Solution category: External problem
 
We have checked and did not find any error logs in OPM Application.
 
We have checked with deployment Team and they re-installed DX part from OCA158859 deployment.
 
After deployment we restarted OPM and OPMWEB Application and further asked SOC Team to check the issue.
 
As per the update from SOC Team, they have restarted test environment (Soc simulator).
 
After SOC restart, we asked Testing Team to retest the issue and as confirmed by Testing Team issue is resolved.

*Comments From Markus:*

issue is reolved as the TNB was missing. If you like to take over the phone numbers, then you need to provide an TNB.

So, NO ZAR issue!;;;",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

There is also freeze in production starting by mid of next week as End of year freeze and we have to discuss with operations before, if some urgent fix can be deployed or not.

However, once we know if you can deliver as patch and WHEN you can deliver, we decide on next steps.

Hi Satish,

Could you please check multimapper properly, because these code value is coming from multimapper addon.

please find the below screenshot

!beeb95d9-d59d-48cc-816e-3c41ecac3aad.png!

hence this is not an OSE issue, it’s multimapper issue;;;","05/Jan/24 1:57 PM;gokul.vade@vodafone.com;HI [~bharath.krishnamurthy@vodafone.com] 
can you please check description of this defect ?

Also if this need to be corrected from Multimapper then what is fixed by TechM ?

If i remember after discussion only we have created this defect and added the user story details also.;;;","05/Jan/24 2:23 PM;ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com;There was a meeting with Marco beginning of December, and only after that TechM was communicating to give a fix.

So if you give it back to Marco now, this is confusing. Same question like raised from Gokul I am also having.;;;","05/Jan/24 6:57 PM;bharath.krishnamurthy@vodafone.com;[~natasa.dimovic1@vodafone.com] [~satish.dhere1@vodafone.com] [~gokul.vade@vodafone.com] [~ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com]

Hi All,
 
To get the defect issue fixed two things are needed
 # Fix from PCAT where it should send the value as Access_Supplier,Rollout_Status

 # Fix from OSE.

Initially OSE used to convert the Access_Supplier, Rollout_Status to Uppercase and now with OSE fix if Pcat sends the value as Access_Supplier OSE sends the same with out converting to Upper case.

In the current build OSE fix is available and as the pcat is having the value as ACCESS_SUPPLIER ROLLOUT_STATUS then the same is being sent from OSE.

so this should be also fixed from pcat where it should send the value as Accesss_Supplier, Rollout_Status

If the pcat is corrected it will work.;;;","09/Jan/24 1:31 PM;marco.abraham01@vodafone.com;Changes on multimapper side are done within PCAT version 1166.;;;","09/Jan/24 1:44 PM;satish.dhere1@vodafone.com;Hello All,

if we use only valid VO numbers, which are present in POS-FE VO numbers, orders will processed, without reporting  the invalid (unknown) number.

Additional, as we do not have any change in that VO number interface – there is no necessary need to import data in the test and there is no pending demand for that. For test cases it would be possible to fill in a file manually.

We do not have any problems regarding VO numbers in production, since updates are coming on regular schedule.

So as Discussed with Gokul and Lukas will Close this defect. Also Find Reference email in attachments.;;;",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i dont see in the attachments the submit order to OGW.

also i dont find in the logs any of the orders you mention.
i think this error coming from validation of the schema that is sent by Omnius.
i saw this error in the requests that you send:
The 'AreaCode' element is invalid - The value '' is invalid according to its datatype 'String' - The actual length is less than the MinLength value.
you need to check if the request you sent was without or with empty AreaCode;;;","24/Nov/23 11:15 AM;satish.dhere1@vodafone.com;[~bharath.krishnamurthy@vodafone.com]

Hi Simran,
Based on further analysis identified that this is PCAT data which we get for Footnote products under the fields Footnote text. This text is imported as part of PCAT import and passed to SendDocumentRequest further.

Also this is existing behavior and now if want to correct this then it should be CR or SRT based on discussion with BA.

Could you please discuss with VF BA once and confirm on this.;;;","05/Dec/23 6:33 PM;bharath.krishnamurthy@vodafone.com;Shruti Kanchan

I double checked in our logs and attached them here as well (cable rules artifact logs), maybe they help.
The scenario I clicked was:
 * load existing KIP customer
 * open kip package
 * open (new) mobile package
 * select any bundle eligible mobile tariff -> bundle drawer pops up
 * create the bundle by clicking the bundle drawer
 * go to checkout -> see message
 * logs of this state: [^cable_rules_artifact_OS47914_pre_workaround.log]
 * open kip package
 * select any option and deselect it again
 * logs of this state:
[^cable_rules_artifact_OS47914_post_workaround.log]

When checking the logs notice that no posting rules are executed after the bundle is created and before the workaround is applied.

Hi Alexander/Simon,

This is not a code issue I have checked working PCAT with the ACC1/ACC2 codebase in my local environment and it's working fine, seems something wrong with the ACC2 PCAT.

I have checked Rules manager and some differences found in the rules also in both the PCAT's so both PCT’s are not same.

Total Rules: 73185 
Mobile: 62760
KIP Ruls: 5168
KABLE TV Rules: 4450

The problem is, that ACC2 is having January catalogue since today, as PST is testing next release. So maybe first of all the issue has to be reproducable with new catalogue.

Hi Alexander/Simon,
 
 For extended shopping cart min max equal warning rules, there is not relation with cable post rule results or execution.
The rule which is problematic, is a max(0) rule and service to category rule. So if this rule’s service source expression evaluates to true than it will check if cart have max 0 number of products only from the target category. So if product OMNIUSTVCHANGEDMARKER is not part of the package then problematic rule service source expression will evaluate to true and further it will show warning if from target category we have more then 0 products in cart.;;;","14/Dec/23 2:55 PM;simon.auch@vodafone.com;Hi [~bharath.krishnamurthy@vodafone.com],

the relation is implicit, the posting rules select the OMNIUSTVCHANGEDMARKER once there is any change to the package. OSF needs to call the posting rules after any change to cable packages including bundle rules.

Hi Alexander/Simon,
 
The logic implemented long back cannot be modified as it may cause additional adversary problems. However, if you require this logic to be changed, it will require the involvement of design team.;;;","14/Dec/23 4:54 PM;simon.auch@vodafone.com;[~ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com], I am not sure if there was any more specific documentation (I will keep searching for a bit), but the following HLD already has a section:
|*Cable artifact rules*
 
The Cable Catalog and PLM colleagues have requested their own rules engine to be applied in the configurator. This is realised with a plugin development where Cable colleagues can upload their Rules Artifact as part of the PLM process. This Rules Artifact consists of the same Sales Rules (in PHP language/cable-speak) that is used currently in ECC front-ends. OMNIUS will share the full-shoppingcart (all packages) to the Rules Artifact, the rules artifact will process ruling, and return the shoppingcart object with modified cable orderlines in Kabel TV, KIP and KUD packages to be displayed in OMNIUS. The Rules Artifact will be called both before a product is selected (on show of configurator, pre-condition) {*}as well as after selecting a product (on adding to the shoppingcart, post-condition){*}. OMNIUS will not be able to have special GUI handling like for internal OMNIUS sales rules when using the Artifact.|

From a slightly newer HLD:
|Apart from the Omnius compatibility rules for cable, specific precondition and postcondition rules from cable are also evaluated within the Cable Rules Artifact. *With each change in the configurator (for cable products) the Omnius rules and Cable rules artifact are evaluated in a loop, until a stable state is reached.* |

As explained in the call (and in previous comments on this ticket):

the checkout is blocked by a rule that comes from the pcat because the product OMNIUSTVCHANGEDMARKER is not selected.
the product is added by the posting rules of the cable rules artifact if there is any change to the TV package
after the bundle is created the TV package is changed as it now contains VB4

OGWOrderlineID field lenght reached 10 digits last week in production. This field is restricted to 9 digits in the interface descriptions, however OGW and Omnius were able to handle 10 digits and did not give any error message. System was just passing over this longer value to backends.
VORAS was keeping to the interface description, and once trying to process the orders for Mobile Retail within VORAS, error message was send back and order stuck.

Enhancement from VORAS side was developed, to be able to handle more digits. 
On ACC, we were still only in an area of 8 digits for OGWorderlineID.

To be able to retest the fix from VORAS side, we needed to increase the sequence for OGWOrderlineID in ACC1 database. This was done together with ADBA team and Amdocs - see attached mail.

ACC2 stayed unchanged. 

 

*Defect stays open with me:*
1) Until we are sure no other impact was there on ACC1 E2E flows after this hard change in the database
2) Until we have decided how to handle ACC2 as this is still working with 8 digits ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,OS-47834,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,OS-47834,,,,,,,"29/Nov/23 9:48 PM;ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com;AW_ OSF Wave 8_1 _ ACC2 _ Prod ACC Test Env _ OGWorderlineID enhancement test for more than 9 digits_ testing .msg;https://jira.sp.vodafone.com/secure/attachment/1184413/AW_+OSF+Wave+8_1+_+ACC2+_+Prod+ACC+Test+Env+_+OGWorderlineID+enhancement+test+for+more+than+9+digits_+testing+.msg","22/Nov/23 8:24 PM;ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com;OSF _ ACC2 Env _ OGW sequence change for OGWOrderLine ID.msg;https://jira.sp.vodafone.com/secure/attachment/1179527/OSF+_+ACC2+Env+_+OGW+sequence+change+for+OGWOrderLine+ID.msg","20/Nov/23 1:55 PM;ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com;RE_ OSF VOARS Issue_ Reconfigure OSF ACC to also have 10 Digits.msg;https://jira.sp.vodafone.com/secure/attachment/1177127/RE_+OSF+VOARS+Issue_+Reconfigure+OSF+ACC+to+also+have+10+Digits.msg",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Mobile Retail orders cannot be processed within VORAS,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,OS-44876,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,OGW ACC2 DB sequences has been updated,,Mobile,,OGW,ACC,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Green,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"0|i8irxj:",9223372036854775807,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Backlog - UNCOVERED,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Environment,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Amdocs -> OGW,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"20/Nov/23 6:42 PM;ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com;Result Sanity for ACC2: processing Mobile Retail with VORAS still working fine, although ACC2 is not enhanced so far ;;;","21/Nov/23 10:28 PM;ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com;Planning implementation (sequence change on database) on ACC2 for beginning of next week.

Solution category : Configuration Defect
 
For this we also checked with deployment team for any deployment miising but deployment team suggested NO Deployment is missed from deployment Side in IT and PR.after that Someshwar suggested to dev team,Lig team and Tid team to lets connect today again with all required colleagues and will proceed with troubleshooting.so we have scheduled a call with Developer,LIG team,TID team.
 
 
After Investigation  Yosef suggested  FTTH DG - OPM-SBUS-SPRI Connection Issue is resolved.
The root cause was a wrong SOAP-Action configured in LIG due to a manual WSDL update last week.
 
So we are answering this ticket.

in Production we don't have Multiplexer where the 2 services of VORAS: GetOrder, GetOrderList are directly connected to individual environment.
So in PROD: payload validation for these services is set as None/False where due to which OGW allowed to accept the validation of Orderline more than 9 digits where VORAS had validation set to 9  within their application due to which this scenario failed.

For ACC Env : The issue was occurred because the validation of the Payload(9 digit restriction) was set to true.

just to make sure we have same understanding of Home passed GPON.

It's just to display a Orange_Red colour in availablity check and show a pop up message.

Ticket was initally raiced because it was just displayed for 750 Mbit, but VFP sents more Bandwiths with Orange_Red avilability back. Ticket was Reopened, because now there is no moire Orange_Red displayed.

 

*Dos:*
 * At homes_passed address there needs to show all bandwiths which received by VFP in Orange_Red colour in availability check.
 * PopUp MEssage will be shown

The changes implemented in DGW epic was for showing serviceability result in the first tab regarding technology with highest priority corresponding to 1000 Mbits in the colour green. The results in the first tab is what is reflected for the 2nd tab Produktverfügbarkeit.

The Orange_ROT information requirement for GPON was only for the serviceability bar and not for Produktverfügbarkeit;;;","01/Dec/23 8:24 PM;lukas.haes1@vodafone.com;[~shruti.kanchan@vodafone.com] [~bharath.krishnamurthy@vodafone.com]

fix is ready by OGW but there is an issue with the request from Omnius.
according to the user story: OS-33938, the values for Rollout_Status and Access_Supplier should be mapped like so: Data/CommercialList/CommercialDetails/SystemAdditionalData[AttributeCode=""Access_Supplier""]/AttributeValue

in the request that you sent i can see that Rollout_Status and Access_Supplier are mapped like so:
DATA/OrderLineList/OrderLine/ComponentList/Component/SystemAdditionalData/AttributeCode



in that case even after the fix from OGW the request to OM will still missed the  Rollout_Status and Access_Supplier values;;;","21/Nov/23 3:23 PM;ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com;[~vikash.saurav@vodafone.com]  can you please comment on the last information from Ran that even if it will be fixed  by OGW also something on TechM side is wrong.

Hi Devi,

 

MOVE means different service address

 VKD -> UME
 UME -> DSL
 UME -> VKDAs per HLD wave 2


*Expected behaviour as follow* Customer- Data (address) Section
 Not Editable and prefilled with service addressBilling section
 Reuse existing Customer billing address details (dropdown) and dropdown in editable format where another billing address can capture by agent.Migration


 DSL -> VKD{*}Expected behaviour as follow{*}Customer- Data (address) Section

 ;;;","20/Nov/23 10:37 PM;ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com;Shared latest comment with business, as still customer adress is expected to be editable.

 

Billing adress behavior seems to look ok, which means that Unity to VKD, and VKD to Unity also needs to have selectable values in dropdown.;;;","24/Nov/23 8:37 PM;ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com;Hi all,

I have discused with business and this is *expected behavior for the following Move scenarios:*

 
|*Move*|*Customer Adress section*|*Billing Section* |*Delivery Section*| |
|Unity to VKD|prefilled with (NEW) service address|different options selectable in dropdown 
(Service adress, customer adress, different adress e.g. )
 |different options selectable in dropdown e.g. different adress, pickup location | |
|VKD to Unity|prefilled with (NEW) service address|different options selectable in dropdown 
(Service adress, customer adress, different adress e.g. )|different options selectable in dropdown e.g. different adress, pickup location| |

 

Please check about this, actually our understanding was that prefilled with new service adress is original requirement (and not prefilled with former service adress)

Hi All,

Basically here this looks to me an improvement topic. Please involve VF design team to process further.

As per wave2 Design and HLD, in MOVE usecase the Checkout (customer details) is in readonly format. ref screenshot.

!5d3a4244-04b9-45da-b77c-f0c023c11b9c.png!

there is no change for this usecase and section since wave2.

this is not a valid defect.;;;","05/Dec/23 9:57 PM;ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com;[~bharath.krishnamurthy@vodafone.com]  this means that customer adress should be prefilled with NEW service adress right? This is currently not the case, its prefilled with earlier service adress before we move to new service adress. ;;;","12/Dec/23 7:17 PM;ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com;[~bharath.krishnamurthy@vodafone.com]  can you please check my last comment?

As understood, customer adress should be prefilled with (NEW) service address in Move scenarios, right?

As I understood, customer adress should be prefilled with (NEW) service address in Move scenarios but this is not happening here. Only because of this, we have asked to be able to change this adress, as we want to change it to the service adress. if it IS ALREADY prefilled with the service adress, all good - so this would be sufficient

""nonStandardRate"": 17.64, 

which with VAT makes ~20.99€.

The product itself however does not seem to indicate that it has a price nor a non standard rate, both of which should however not be necessary for unity inventory products.

It is noteworthy that the product itself has no price configured in the product setup, maybe the display in the contract summary of OSF does not work if it is an inventory product without a price (and without a non standard rate actually configured in the product setup)?

The very first analysis was by me and as far as I can tell nothing in the comments suggests that the assumptions I had were analysed?

For the result of my analysis see the first comment [OS-47333] OSF Wave 8.1 ACC2 - Contract Summary: Price of old TV Product is missing (only OSF) - Vodafone Global Jira.

I also checked again for a random customer having this product that the inventory returned by vkdgateway does indeed contain a price.

TL;DR:

This behaviour is reproducible with a vast range of PCAT versions (basically any version containing UMDKLM should suffice).

The product has no price configured, but for (unity) inventory products the price from the inventory must be used. 
VkdGateway correctly returns a price in the inventory of the customer.

We had a call with TechM team to analyse this defect Further and got the below information from them

They compared the back office configuration between one failed scenario(Digitaler Kabelanschluss m. Service ) and pass scenario(Digital Kabelanschluss)

and made the below changes to their environment to check whether it is working with failed scenario:

 

*1.They tried to change the price of the failed product and product frontend visibilty of the failed product same as the Passed one*

i.e They changed the price of Digitaler Kabelanschluss m. Service from 0 to 20,99 in BO and product Visibility as below (Previously only inverntory is selected for thiis product)

!image-2024-02-21-16-14-57-020.png|width=330,height=141!

And then when checked in front end , We are able to see the product details in front end 

 

*2. As we mentioned that price of the Unity Product should not be taken from Back Office*

To check this one , they tried to change one product price from 20,99 to 20 euros in back office in their environment 

When checked in front end , we are able to see the product price has changed from 20,99 to 20 Euros

!image-2024-02-21-16-20-15-601.png|width=718,height=118!

 

Kindly let us know whether this behaviour is correct?

[~devi.jampana@vodafone.com] 

As discussed there is no such handling for this usecase; where Overriding of PCAT price with Customer Ibase for any product.

In Omnius; it always consider customer’s Ibase product price from pcat RMM(reverse Multimapped) or via (service all {{{}GetNonStandardRates{}}})

So this is not a defect ruther i would say it must be CR to have such behaviour handle in Omnius.

I am not the correct person to decide if this is a bug or not, but I also have not heard of any past CRs to change this behaviour.

As [~markus.meissner@vodafone.com] is the application owner of OSF I assume he should be able to provide the necessary decision if a CR should be created for this issue.
If such a CR is to be created I can support from cable side with the relevant endpoints and documentation for them.

As Discussed over the call , Please do find the below outcome of the call

We identified that there are uncertain delays in the OM application queue where for few orders its response to the updateCustomerReactionCall is getting delayed due to which OGW is getting timeout.
Also this we suspect it might be due to some performance of these queue . @Tran, Khang Lac, DXC: from OM side will be checking if something can be done here or is there any difference between IT & PR Environment queue.
@Ran Farjun@Ketaki Bhide@Yamini Majety (151775): Please as a WA can we check if we can help here to put some delay(10-15 secs) from OGW side before triggering the updateCustomerReactionCall towards OM;;;","20/Nov/23 1:42 PM;rohan.kumbhar@vodafone.com;Checking with Amdocs team if any Temp WA is possible or not to delay some time to send the OMCustomerReactionStatus Update call;;;","20/Nov/23 2:37 PM;ran.farjun1@vodafone.com;Hi,
This is will cause performance deration in production so as advised by solution team we cant add delay as a solution;;;","20/Nov/23 7:25 PM;rohan.kumbhar@vodafone.com;Checked with OGW Team. as per them they cannot add delay for the service as it may impact some other flows which cannot be predicted.
So request is to check performance solution on OM side.

As per OM -- issue is with Queues which are responding sometime slow for few orders and its intermittent due to Performance of servers and as of now nothing can be done from dev side to fine tune it

Hello,

 

After checking the log files, I found that PHP is failing for all statuses on the pvr server:

 

This perfectly explains why we are losing random statuses, sometimes for the package, sometimes for the order. As you can see at the end of the list, the Completed-Success status for the package was also tried to be sent.

 

Please review the configuration of StatusDaemon on pvr server. Apparently, the *PhpScriptPath* parameter in Dynacommerce.StatusQueueService.exe.config points to a wrong file. Probably it should be ‘{*}_/opt/SP/WEB_DATA/ACC1/omnius/osf-telesales-int-acc1/shell/amqp/consumer.php_{*}’ (after Zend decommissioning).

 

I suggest to compare the whole config file with the corresponding one on the ovr server and adjust all parameters, accordingly. Also, please verify whether all JobDaemon instances refer to the right php files.

 

 

 

Aside Pritam from TID confirm,

Thank you, Marcin,

I have checked and yes there is some issue with config, not sure how status daemon is different on both servers.

I will update status daemon on pvr from ovr.

 

 

Same mail attached. ;;;","10/Nov/23 12:21 PM;dadasaheb.narbat@vodafone.com;[~nasir.sayyad@vodafone.com]  Please check and confirm here as well.;;;","10/Nov/23 1:48 PM;nasir.sayyad@vodafone.com;Hello,

Hi Lalitha,

RCA of this defect is already updated in the above(Previous) comments.

 

In the logs file, Script path was not modified before, it was pointing to the old file

After Pritam from TID team has been modified the path details to the new file and changes has been done in config file, it started working.

Hi Akash,
 
Mentioned issue already fixed. now you are getting another issue that, one field is missing ""Geburtsdatum"" in customer details, this is different issue.

So in this case the new order id = 900000073 where while searching it is only calculating 73 ignoring all the 0 digits as they are null.

So with the input above, we are always expecting true for below function call as result:

if availability.hasHighestPriority(1000000, 'GRUEN,GRUEN_GRAU,GELB', 'FTTH-L2-BSA-DTAG', 'FIBRE', '(AREA_CLASSIFICATION;00)') == true,  then ....
if availability.hasHighestPriority(1000000, 'GRUEN', 'FTTH-L2-BSA-DTAG', 'FIBRE', '(ACCESS_SUPPLIER;DTAG)') == true, then

Unfortunatelly the function call only returns true if the key is set to ACCESS_SUPPLIER, all other keys would get FALSE instead of.
THIS IS WRONG !
And need to be fixed ASAP.

Attached are 
-  PCAT-refData (whole fixNet Package)
-  Debug Log with function call displayed as detail
-  oref492_serviceAbillity.xml as mentioned above


*{color:#4C9AFF}Below notices after meeting with Shruti, Avasarala:{color}*
just to make sure, that we’re understanding each other correctly.

I’m not explicitly asking for key-value pairs of PROJECT_REFERENCE and AREA_CLASSIFICATION, never !!!
It could be any key-value pairs of the list, of the AdditionalItemProperty list.

As mentioned on the requirement https://jira.sp.vodafone.com/browse/OS-38712 as Important Hint,
“It should look up every configured pair on the same response item …. as the existing function availablity.hasTechnology”, see below highlighted text.

Multiple things are interesting for this order:
 # Natasa did select VP0 in the checkout, but it is missing from the order.
 ## while testing another bug we noticed that the technician options might not be added to the order when the agent selects them in the dropdown.
 # In the IBP VP0 is added to the order because of the rule ""add_VP0_for_ENV_NE4_technician_install_address"" which (among other things) checks 
{code:java}
object installation type is technician-install {code}
(which should correspond to the ""sehbereitschaft"" selected in the OSF checkout)
In contrast to
{code:java}
object availabilities contains self-install {code}
(which should correspond to the address property self-install)

 # If VP0 is not properly added by the dropdown in the checkout as well as not being selected by the rule due to the object installation type not being processed correctly then it might explain why OSF does send WTXN*:
The rule ""modem_mapping_for_new_customer_at_selfinstall_address"" applies either to

 ## new kip customers that select kip + tv without VP0/1V1

 ## new kip customer without tv

 # The first case would be taken by OSF, thus replacing WTX15 with WTXN15. while the IBP will take neither of them, thus not replacing WTX15

I think the first step must be that OSE must analyse why VP0 is not added to the shopping cart when selecting it in the dropdown.

Additionally no cable product logic seems to be executed after the value in the dropdown is selected for the whole rest of the order process, I was under the impression that at least before the checkout overview the cable product logic should be executed again. It would be nice if this could also be checked.

Result: during the checkout I can select 1V1 as a TV technician and TECYESKIP as a KIP technician.
The logs indicate that 1V1 is never passed to cable product logic as selected.
I attached the log of the session.
[^cable_rules_artifact_OS44322.log]

The log should contain an entry like ""1V1|true"" which it does not.

I also reproduced the issue with the mock [Cable_Address_Type_NE4-VVO|https://ash-sb5-telesales.osf.paps-vf.de/agent/account/login?showProductCodes=true&TC_ID=Cable_Address_Type_NE4-VVO] which results in VP0 being selectable in the checkout. Again in the log we cannot find VP0 ever being passed to the cable product logic as selected.

[^cable_rules_artifact_OS44322_VP0.log]

Visiblity in Order overview for product 1V1/VP0 is controlled by PCAT configuration and rules.;;;","29/Sep/23 3:00 PM;simon.auch@vodafone.com;Hi Vikash,
as the logs show the PCAT returns VP0 and 1V1 as visible in this case, so maybe we have a different understanding what ""visible"" in this case means?
My understanding of visible in this case is:
 * the last call of the cable rules plugin by osf returns a list of packages, each containing a list of products.
 * a product is ""visible"" for a dropdown if the property ""visible"" in the last return value of the cable rules plugin for this particular product was ""true"".

 ** this is especially distinct from the ""visibility"" of tariffs in the configurator which depends on more information like:
 *** is the product selected
 *** is it configured to be shown in the configurator
 *** is the product ""visible"" according to the last result of the cable rules plugin

*According to the logs 1V1/VP0 is visible in this case but is never selected by OSF even if the agent selects it in the dropdown*

This is even underlined by the fact that 1V1/VP0 are shown in the dropdown {*}which would not be the case if the were not ""visible""{*}.;;;","03/Oct/23 5:09 PM;dadasaheb.narbat@vodafone.com;Hi [~vikash.saurav@vodafone.com]  Could you please share latest update here and Chage status to InProgress. ;;;","05/Oct/23 1:15 PM;vikash.saurav@vodafone.com;h3.

Hi [~vikash.saurav@vodafone.com] ,
thank you for the investigation.
According to our investigation we do not have any Compatibility Rules that deselect 1V1, and as said before 1V1 also never appears in the input to the cable rules plugin. 
Also check this previous comment for a log: https://jira.sp.vodafone.com/browse/OS-44322?focusedId=2949361&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels:comment-tabpanel#comment-2949361

As things stand there is nothing cable logic can do to deselect the product as the product is never select from the point of view of the cable product logic.

Please investigate on your side why 1V1 is never passed to CREP as selected once it is selected in the shopping cart/checkout.

Best regards

Hi [~simon.auch@vodafone.com]  ,

This issue on Sky or Cable backend we talking above may be related to CR676. Check with VF as we don't have any implementation on OSE for CR676.

Also we have some discussions going on for CR676 with on [OS-44236] SIT1 | Retail/Telesales | CR676 | Cable order is failing with error JSON validation failure - Vodafone Global Jira

[~natasa.dimovic1@vodafone.com] fyi;;;","11/Oct/23 2:53 PM;simon.auch@vodafone.com;Hi Vikash,

I do not think it is related to CR676 as it has nothing to do with the json schema, but a change in that CR could of course have impacted OSE to behave differently. According to my knowledge however CR676 only had OGW impact until recently and should have no impact whatsoever on OSE and with which products OSE calls the cable product logic.

As I said before, from our perspective there is absolutely nothing cable can do about this *because we do not control with which products cable product logic is called by from OSE.*

*Please investigate in OSE why the cable product logic is not called with the product after it is selected in the checkout.* Before this is done there will be nothing we can do to help with this issue, so please refrain to assigning it back to me before this is investigated. If you have further question please set up a meeting with me.

Hi [~natasa.dimovic1@vodafone.com] 

As already mentioned you that this defect we have fixed on the rule level where the 1V1 was not sent as selected true. After fix this is sent as selected true to Cable artifact rule. Next Cable artifact process the input and send back final list which should be present in cart.

This can be verified by enabled Cable artifact rules on ACC and verify that 1V1 is sent on rules input for the package or not.

We can verify If we are sending 1V1 as true or false on artifact rule log file. If sending as true then plugin has to return the selected product back to OSE to keep that file in cart.

Please check and confirm;;;","09/Nov/23 5:41 PM;natasa.dimovic1@vodafone.com;Hi [~simon.auch@vodafone.com] could you please check the last comment?

the problem only seems to appear for addresses that allow 1V1 (instead of VP0).
One such address: Hagelstangestr. 30, München;;;","06/Dec/23 8:20 PM;simon.auch@vodafone.com;I further analysed this issue and found the following:

Orders created by OSF contain a field 
{code:json}
""apartmentDetails"":{""technicianNeeded"":
true/false
}
{code}
As far as I can tell from tests the field is always true if and only if the agent selected the technician_yes option in either the TV or the KIP dropdown during the checkout.

This information should also be passed to the cable rules plugin, in the field `IServiceAddress::technicianNeeded`.

After the selection of technician options in the dropdown the cable posting rules are executed again by OSF, but the the `technicianNeeded` field is not set to true (as it should be if the agent previously selected VP0/TECYESKIP in the technician dropdowns).

This can be checked by searching for `technicianNeeded` in the following log: [^cable_rules_artifact_OS44322_technicianNeeded.log] 
Notice that the last execution contains `TECYESKIP|true`, since the agent selected the kip technician to be necessary.

For fixing this bug the cable rules artifact logs can be used to check if the technician needed flag is passed to the cable rules plugin correctly.
In the meantime we will try to provide a workaround that might resolve most of the issues as well. We have an experimental workaround since version V2330_2024_01_00_032.

Okay, let me go through your message step by step.

For the first test case:
 * I can reproduce it :)
 * I think that only the TV dropdown is shown is correct (according to the up to now still best documentation we have: [Scenario dimension ""Technician appointment"" - OSF - Vodafone Global Confluence|https://confluence.sp.vodafone.com/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=103985437]).
 * I think VP0 being selectable is also correct (again according to above documentation, and to some tests we have [Quelle von vkdTechnicianOptions.feature - productSetup - webgit (kabeldeutschland.de)|https://webgit.kabeldeutschland.de/projects/FE/repos/productsetup/browse/4DevelopmentOnly/tests/unified/features/availability/vkdTechnicianOptions.feature#216-236]).
 * VP0 disappearing afterwards sounds problematic and without investigating I have no idea why it would.
 ** VP0 not being selected anymore however explains that my workaround doesn't work because it relied on the presence of the technician options instead of the flag.

For the second case:
 * I can reproduce the behaviour :)
 * I don't understand the problem with this though? For this particular example you can proceed either with no technician at all (TECNOKIP, TECNOTV are both selectable) or with a technician (TECYESKIP, 1V1 can be selected together).
 * If the issue is the error message, what would be the expected behaviour if a different technician selection would be made by the agent?
 * If the issue is that the TV dropdown is visible at all: that confuses me a bit as well, since our tests would indicate that only the kip options should be shown in this case: [Quelle von vkdTechnicianOptions.feature - productSetup - webgit (kabeldeutschland.de)|https://webgit.kabeldeutschland.de/projects/FE/repos/productsetup/browse/4DevelopmentOnly/tests/unified/features/availability/vkdTechnicianOptions.feature#239-259]

The answer why the whole section is missing can only be given by OSF.

If I had to guess I would assume OSF is hardcoded to check for TECYESKIP, TECNOKIP, UMTECKIP:NOO, UMTECKIP:YES. One of the relevant tests in our test suite is likely:
{code:java}
    Scenario: New cable TV (KAA) and KIP customer without self-install on NE4-VVO address
        Given a KDG service address where ""analog and digital"" TV is available with object category ""NE4-VVO""
        And a KDG service address where internet with data transfer rate ""1000"" is available
        And self-install is 'not available'
        And a selection
            | productCode |
            | TC2         |
            | 01H:B06     |
        When I get the availability and basket
        Then the products have the states
            | productCode  | state         |
            | TC2          | selected      |
            | 01H:B06      | selected      |
            | TECNOKIP     | not available |
            | TECYESKIP    | not available |
            | TECNOTV      | not available |
            | TECYESTV     | not available |
            | VP0          | selectable    |
            | 1V1          | not available |
            | UMTECKIP:NOO | not available |
            | UMTECKIP:YES | not available | {code}
According to my understanding no kip technician is needed at VVO addresses since the TV technician will handle the installation.
As with the other bug tickets I think we need clarification from business what the expected behaviour is.

Thank you!;;;","21/Sep/23 1:42 PM;simon.auch@vodafone.com;Hi Natasa, just for my understanding: what is the impact of not booking VP0?
As far as I understand the relevant BI order for TV is created anyway, right?
It's just that the customer might not get an information on the CS/confirmation letter that a technician will be sent out?

I think this is a cable bug, [~benjamin.sachse@vodafone.com] can you prioritize this in our backlog?;;;","21/Sep/23 1:49 PM;natasa.dimovic1@vodafone.com;Hi [~simon.auch@vodafone.com] yes, I think the only impact is, that the customer does not see this information in the CS. I'm not sure if it is also an impact, that ANS is not booked, if VP0 is booked. If VP0 would be booked, then ANS is also booked.

 ;;;","21/Sep/23 5:30 PM;simon.auch@vodafone.com;*Guess:* 
Cable product logic tries to rebuild the selection of the agent in each step. This means that certain clickflows are not really supported.

If their are for example two products A and B, A is visible, B is not, selecting A replaces A with B.
If the agent now selects A, A will be added to the selection and the product logic will replace it with B, the agent will see B in the selection.
If the cable product logic is executed again B is not a valid selection because it is not visible.

In this case A would be VP0, and B would be 1V1.

I do not think that there is a simple fix for this issue if my guess is correct.

The two options I see:
 # do not restrict the visibility of VP0 in this case
 ** this would imply that the agent could directly select VP0
 ** since VP0 and 1V1 are mapped to the same dropdown option in OSF -> the agent can only select VP0 together with 1V1, the replacement of 1V1 with VP0 then actually just removes 1V1 since VP0 is already selected.
 # maybe 1V1 should not be selectable in the first place
 ** instead of allowing the agent to select 1V1 which will automatically be replaced with VP0 allow the agent to select VP0 directly instead.

*Open questions:*

Which option is preferred by business?
 * if option 2 is preferred: should this also applied to other portals

What exactly are the affected cases? 
 * likely all test cases where the rule that replaces 1V1 with VP0 applies. 
 * Can business confirm that all cases affected by the rule below should be changed with either option 1 or 2?
 * The rule is: 

{code:java}
Rule 'Replace_1V1_with_VP0_when_ordering_KAI':
When
    selected products contain '1V1' and
    condition 'new_kip_order' applies and
    condition 'digitalSelected' applies
then
    deselect '1V1' and
    select 'VP0' with contract relation set to the main analog product. {code}
 ;;;","27/Sep/23 2:10 PM;nina.pickl@vodafone.com;As agreed yesterday, the issue will be discussed by the Ash team with Christian Lienbacher, regarding the expectations from a business perspective.;;;","27/Sep/23 6:46 PM;fabian.keilbach@vodafone.com;Analysis by Team Ash so far:
 * In case the scenario is reproduced as outlined in the ticket none of 1V1 or VP0 ever gets in the selection of the Cable Rules Plugin even when 1V1 is selected in the frontend
 * In case of ONLY booking TV (no KIP), we can select 1V1 in the frontend as expected and also see it in our Cable Rules Plugin logs 

We thus are lead to believe this is a problem of the frontend not putting the correct (or any) product in the selection in the defect case and therefore require a retest by techM in the following manner
 * Scenario to be reproduced shall be the flow described as steps to reproduce in the ticket
 * Cable logging enabled as in below image:

We did our analysis together with @Timo Hurai on OSE side and found the problematic checkout product 1V1 is not allowed after Processing of post cable rules. Below are the list of products which are allowed as part of cart after saving change provider details.
 
 {{=== THE FOLLOWING PRODUCTS SHOULD BE PRESENT IN CART AFTER CABLE POST CONDITION: CKH8, SN3, MFT, KH8, CD5, DH5, HDC:000, DV2:T02, TC2, DCX, SC, TOEVN, 9I0:B00, HO1:000, PC1:B01, AO0, FM4:B00, VSA, PAS, 01H:B06, OF5:B00, 69K, V3G, V3K, MTV, WTX21, 3K6, TECYESKIP, KIPOPENEDMARKER}}
First before post cable rules processing the product we added into cart please find below screenshot

!image-2023-10-05-13-08-57-210.png!

But after some seconds once the Post cable rules processing happened we removed the product becuase its not part of allowed list.
 
 {{=== REMOVED FROM CART PROD WITH SKU: 1V1 ===}}
Please find attached screenshot from DB after post processing of cable rules.

!image-2023-10-05-13-09-30-710.png!

For Cable packages we don’t compatibility rules on OSE side, addition / deletion of cable products from cart depend on Cable Pre/Post rules. Kindly assign back this with above information and also I am attaching the CableOmniusRules.log where we can find the details of on same.

[^CableOmniusRules.log];;;","05/Oct/23 6:06 PM;simon.auch@vodafone.com;Hi [~vikash.saurav@vodafone.com] ,
thank you for the investigation.
According to our investigation we do not have any Compatibility Rules that deselect 1V1, and as said before 1V1 also never appears in the input to the cable rules plugin. 
For completeness we attach the log of the cable rules plugin so you can check for yourself that 1V1 is never passed to the cable product logic as selected: [^cable_rules_artifact372637.log] 

When working with the log searching for ""1V1|true"" and ""1V1|false"" returns the corresponding input state of the product. You will find that no entry exist for ""1V1|true"".

As things stand there is nothing cable logic can do to deselect the product as the product is never select from the point of view of the cable product logic.

Please investigate on your side why 1V1 is never passed to CREP as selected once it is selected in the shopping cart (as seen in one of your screenshots).

Hi [~natasa.dimovic1@vodafone.com] 

As already mentioned you that this defect we have fixed on the rule level where the 1V1 was not sent as selected true. After fix this is sent as selected true to Cable artifact rule. Next Cable artifact process the input and send back final list which should be present in cart.

This can be verified by enabled Cable artifact rules on ACC and verify that 1V1 is sent on rules input for the package or not.

We can verify If we are sending 1V1 as true or false on artifact rule log file. If sending as true then plugin has to return the selected product back to OSE to keep that file in cart

 

Please check and confirm ;;;","09/Nov/23 5:39 PM;natasa.dimovic1@vodafone.com;Hi [~simon.auch@vodafone.com] could you please check the last comment? Thank you;;;","13/Nov/23 3:54 PM;simon.auch@vodafone.com;Hi [~natasa.dimovic1@vodafone.com],
I can confirm that 1V1 is now passed to the product logic, which I think removes it because no TV technician is needed (due to kip no self install).
Is this still a major bug, given that the correct technician orders in BI are created as far as I understand the ticket?

Hi Srujana,
 
If the customeraddress is the same as the service address then the service address as delivery will not be displayed.

 ;;;","20/Sep/23 10:39 AM;devi.jampana@vodafone.com;Hi [~bharath.krishnamurthy@vodafone.com] 

Thanks for the Information

But if we place TV product and KIP Together

is there a separate logic for TV +KIP Orders?

Then identical to Service Address is showing even if Service address and Customer Address are same

Hi Devi,

Regarding the expected behavior , could you please check with VF BA

I don't know the logic for this field, also this defect is similar to the defect OS-43497

https://jira.sp.vodafone.com/browse/OS-43497

 ;;;","26/Sep/23 3:46 PM;ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com;Hi Bas, the logic for Solstice is not comparable to legacy products. For Solstice products all will share the same logic later on, and for legacy each stack has different logic. So not sure if we can really compare to OS-43497

There needs to be a story also to request to handle KIP orders differently to KIP & TV orders right? So a story which describes it should be implemented in the way it is right now, if its working as designed. 
or is this controlled by VKD rules? 

 ;;;","28/Sep/23 10:18 AM;devi.jampana@vodafone.com;Hi 

Comments from Thomas for the comment(identical to Service address in delivery section  will be shown only when service address and customer address are different):

I do not remember such a requirement and could not find a user story that limits it in the Frontend.

In some cases there are issues in the backend with customer and service address but we just ignore the customer address and use the service address in the backend see user story:

[https://jira-it.unitymedia.de/browse/OSF-427]

[^OSF-427.doc]

 

Also from our understanding:

if Identical to service address is shown for KIP+TV in delivery section when customer address and service address are same

then the same behaviour should be applied to KIP Alone as well

Note : *Technician needed* OR *SelfInstallation* dropdown options visiblity and respective product in SC logic is exisitng and controlled via cable rulez plugin.

(ABK = Yes or No) and *YES* has only scope if there is *Technician needed* dropdown option possible then make this option preset in readonly AND also not add chargeable product in SC.

We have a mutually-exclusive category X ( here: access hardware)

 

If any of this Product A of X is chosen than a Product P (here: Product 10004 Shipping_Fee) should be Defaulted.

Only Exception: if Product B of X (here: Eigenhardware) is choosen, than Product P should not be added

 

We build a rule (here: CR006048)

If not B than defaulted-obligated P (Prio 6)
 
First Result:

If we switch from A to B P stay in the cart

 

I added an additional Prio 1 rule: If P is in the cart -> Do not allow P.

 

Result:

If we switch from A to B P is removed, which is fine.

But if I switch back from B to A I get the error

{color:#FF0000}*Die folgenden Produkte: [10004] Versandkosten können nicht hinzugefügt werden weil sie mit der aktuellen Auswahl nicht kombinierbar sind.*{color}

 

+*Expected Result:*+

Product 10004 should be defaulted or removed just by the rule CR006048, no other rule neccessary

 

 

*Steps to reproduce:*

*-ProcessContext ACQ*
 # *Enter any address.*
 #  *Choose any tarif -> A hardware is defaulted*
 # *Switch to hardware Eigenhardware*
 # *Switch back to any other access hardware -> error message is shown*

First of all we have found a workaround to make this particular business rule working.

However we still have the issue with a defaulted Product P and the check !cart.contains(P)

 

The example here is:

We have a (initial) default rule. If agent selects tariff A default hardware P. Of course this rule is true also in further runs of compRules

Agent switches manually to other hardware Q of this mutually exclusive category

If we have two distinguish rules:
 # cart.containsProduct(P) -> default product X 
 # !cart.containsProduct(P) -> Not ALLOW X 

We get this kind of error message: X cannot be added 

 

Regardless if the first or the second rule gets a higher prio we always run into trouble that either the product is added (but should not) or we get the above error message.

Please explain how to build the rules to make it working the whole time;;;","06/Nov/23 4:14 PM;saiswarup.singhdeo@vodafone.com;[~vikash.saurav@vodafone.com]  Any update on this defect ?;;;","06/Nov/23 5:24 PM;vikash.saurav@vodafone.com;hi [~marco.abraham01@vodafone.com]  can you please share non-working PCAT to reproduce this issue because earlier pcat file which you shared is failing while import.

To have a workaround in place, Marco did some changes on his side, but this is not permanent solution! its just a workaround until TechM has fixed the behavior with permanent fix.
So we should stop discussing that it might be solved already - YES IT IS WORKING -  but with workaround.

TechM has to give a fix for it, so Marco can remove his workaround.

We have done retest and observed the following

While performing move from VKD to UM or from UM to VKD 

We are unable to edit the customer address, so the customer address and service address are different

Note :This defect is that only 1 option available in delivery section when customer address and service address are same 

But now customer address option itself is disabled and we are unable to change

We have also observed that Billing address section was also disabled and only the customer address is preselected in it

Hi Devi/Srujana,

The Checkout Address (customer data section ) must be prefilled and in read-only when existing customer address data are validated via service and then pre-filled.
in case data is incorrect or missing from customer install base then checkout Address section is in editable format.

not sure this topic is related to current incident.

as per my view there must be a new incident with proper data to analyse this usecase.;;;","07/Nov/23 10:13 AM;devi.jampana@vodafone.com;Hi [~bharath.krishnamurthy@vodafone.com] 

As per our understanding ,

All move scenarios functionality should be same(i.e UM TO VKD,VKD TO UM,UM TO DSL ,VKD To DSL)

when we perform VKD to DSL or UM to DSL we can see that customer address section is editable

[~ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com]  [~sebastian.schmittmann1@vodafone.com]  please correct me if i'm wrong here

 

And also we observed that customer address section is editable before this defect was resolved

Hi Devi ,
 

There are 2 new issue now I can see based on comments from VF which are not relevant to this ticket 
 # Customer legal address should be editable

 # Customer delivery section not visible and customer is landed directly to payment section.

Also above defect can be tested if in above scenario it is mandatory to show Delivery section.;;;","09/Nov/23 2:23 PM;ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com;We cannot retest OS-43468 right now as the behavior completely changed after the fix was delivered.

*So we will open new defects and this here will stay open until we can retest.* 

Scenario for this ticket :
-> once you change the adress data in customer adress, delivery section is having only one value

Situation after the fix:

-> *{color:#de350b}you can not change the adress data in customer adress anymore{color}*

So how to retest and close? ;;;","10/Nov/23 2:44 PM;devi.jampana@vodafone.com;Hi All

Can you please look into the below comment

 

Regards

Srujana;;;","20/Sep/23 4:07 PM;simon.auch@vodafone.com;This can be changed on cable side, but I am relatively sure that this was never implemented for Unity.

Without CR-716 the agent could select both ""Anschluss ist bereits sehbereit"" or ""Anschluss ist nicht sehbereit"" but only ""Anschluss ist bereits sehbereit"" would actually do anything (selecting a marker product).

With CR-716 only the option with a valid product selection is left, but functionally everything behaves just like before.
The agent basically just had the illusion of a choice before.

If this behaviour should be changed I think it needs to be clarified if there are other cases for unity in which (at a self install address) the option ""Anschluss ist nicht sehbereit"" should be selectable. The other ES* products come to mind for example.;;;","22/Sep/23 4:50 PM;nina.pickl@vodafone.com;In clarification:

the technician option should be shown if KIP only is booked or is there an exception when booking ES5? If yes, then I would say the wrong option is displayed.

Thank you;;;","03/Feb/25 1:16 PM;tobias.pohlmann@vodafone.com;Hi [~natasa.dimovic1@vodafone.com]  ,
as I understood it, the technician section should never be shown for a KIP-only booking.

In the excel sheet, there are only 2 cases left in which we want to show the section in OSF, which are both TV-only cases.
!image-2025-02-03-08-44-34-740.png|width=1339,height=527!

For this use case, described in the description, the technician option is still displayed in the Access Details.

We are not sure if everything has already been implemented.

If everything has already been implemented then I would suggest to reject this bug. A new bug should be created then. Could you please check if there is maybe a bug on Cable side? Thank you;;;","03/Feb/25 1:33 PM;tobias.pohlmann@vodafone.com;Ah, okay, now I get it.

The reason why it happens here is that this is a Unity address which historically was treated similarly, but differently than VKD with the technician options.

The issue isn't valid issue because we tested on local (acc1 code) with the stub, which worked on SB1, and it is working fine, if it’s a software issue in that case it should not work in the local environment with the stubbed customer.
This probably is PCAT ruling issue so please check with PCAT team.

Please see the attached SS.

We analyzed the debug logs from the ACC environment and concluded, that our developed PCAT rules are executing correctly. Especially because the rules work as expected on our sandboxes, we cannot explain the different behavior with the same software version on ACC and PROD.

That why we assume an environment problem or a software bug.

When we are checking the logs, we can find that CRFN314 is evaluating to true.

If this rule is evaluating to true, then product must be added to cart.

[~natasa.dimovic1@vodafone.com]  The issue isn't valid issue because we tested on local with the stub, which worked on SB1, and it is working fine, if it’s a software issue in that case it should not work in the local environment with the stubbed customer.

This probably is PCAT ruling issue so please check with PCAT team.

It is many time said, that with the same version OSE and PCAT, different behavior are given on different test servers.
So the reason could be:
- the (standard-)libs which OSE software included, are not in the same version on different server
- the webserver, or the workframes on which OSE are running do not have the same version or same configuration on different test servers ...

There could be many reasons, which could be investigated by software developers or admins for test servers, BUT NEVER somebody, who are delivering reference datas (product catalogues) :-D

So I would assign the ticket back to developer team, they should write down the instructruction or installation guide for the deployment team, so that the admins for test servers could check, which system configuration maybe wrong due the installation/instruction guide.

[~natasa.dimovic1@vodafone.com]  We have checked two PCATS with the same code base one is from sb1 environment which is working as expected and another one from the acc1 that is probably published from the dtl4 which is not working properly.

As per our initial investigation it looks like the product C_comfort is removed because it has been considered mutually exclusive product which is why it is removing from the cart.

Hi [~natasa.dimovic1@vodafone.com]  We don't see any issue in our code, as we are completely dependent on cable artifact results and somehow in case of selecting KIP and then Cable TV, we are not getting this product from the cable which is why it is not reflected in the checkout section so please check with the cable team.

can you provide on which information it depends whether or not OSF displays the access details for TV and for KIP?
If this depends on certain product states it would be valuable to know for example which products, which property of this product etc.
If this depends on certain address properties it would be important to know on which address properties like tags, flags, etc.

It would be perfect if you could provide this information for both software versions on the ACC1 (v9.16.6-BB1) and the ACC2 (v9.17.0-BB46).

Thank you very much

Hi [~simon.auch@vodafone.com] 

The cable artifact logs already attached in data.zip file also I am sharing the details related to SKU which are behaving differently when swapping the package in configurator.

thank you for providing the examples, but I was hoping for the actual decisions OSF makes in order to determine whether or not to show the access details during the checkout.
Examples are in this case not sufficient to correctly determine the severity of the problem. 
After knowing the decisions OSF makes I would for example want to be able to now if OSF shows the access details if the cable product logic returns TECNOTV, TECYESTV, 1V1 as not visible, and VP0 as visible.

Thank you and Regards,

Nina;;;","21/Sep/23 1:21 PM;saiswarup.singhdeo@vodafone.com;[~benjamin.sachse@vodafone.com] Any update when it will be fixed ?;;;","21/Sep/23 4:32 PM;simon.auch@vodafone.com;In order to properly fix this I assume that cable and OSF will have to deliver a fix.

According to the answer from [~vikash.saurav@vodafone.com]  https://jira.sp.vodafone.com/browse/OS-42115?focusedId=2910953&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels:comment-tabpanel#comment-2910953 the display of the tv access details depends on the availability of the products TECNOTV and TECYESTV reported by the cable logic.

*Why does the workaround work?*

My *assumption* is that OSF remembers the availability of TECNOTV and/or TECYESTV from a previous execution of the cable logic.

If KIP is selected first, then the first executions of the cable product logic will return TECNOTV and TECYESTV as not available. 

If TV is selected first, then the first executions of the cable product logic will return either TECNOTV and/or TECYESTV as available.

-> This is something that has to be fixed by OSF

{*}What is the implication of the Workaround?{*}{*}{{*}}

Assuming cable product logic would return TECNOTV or TECYESTV as bookable the issue might persist in OSF, since as long as KIP is selected first TECNOTV and TECYESTV will still not be available from the start.

*Open questions from my perspective:*
 * which products exactly control the display of the tv access details in OSF?
 ** Is it only TECYESTV and TECNOTV or also products like VP0, 1V1?
 ** Is this controlled by special tags on products or categories, or are the products hardcoded in OSF?
Maybe [~vikash.saurav@vodafone.com] can answer this question?
 *  in which scenarios should which technician option be bookable in OSF?

 * 
 ** we have a list of ~80 test cases. Some of these are apparently not correct.
 ** Who can go through these test cases with us and determine which of them need to be changed?
 ** Without at least a contact person that can answer this question it will not make sense to start implementation of this ticket.

Following is the answer to the query to show Access details or New connection section for KIP and Kable TV.

For the section to be visible, the cable artifact result must contain at least one product matching the option types.

technician_needed_no 
technician_needed_yes

If there is no result for those options, the section will not be displayed.

Hello [~simon.auch@vodafone.com] , Please find the details below.

It is hard to give an exact timing for this feature since it seems to have been implemented a long time ago. I recommend contact with Vodafone BA for more information.
Unity Media works exactly the same as normal Kable TV and KIP products to display the access details section.

so, PORPDT-345 will not make this requirement obsolete, it will just slightly shift how it looks.

The new requirements are: if only TV is ordered, show the section. If TV + Internet is ordered, don't show it.

The new problem is this:
If the agent books the packages in the following order
 * TV
 * KIP

then the TV accessibility section is shown, but it should not.

The problem is still the same as described by [~simon.auch@vodafone.com] in the comment from 21/Sep/2023: 
OSF seems only to decide on whether to show the accessibility section for TV when the TV package is opened. So,
 * we first open TV and book a TV Connect ---> OSF sees that 1V1 and TECNOTV are available and correctly assumes that it should show the TV accessibility section
 * we then open the internet section and book some GigaZuhause tariff ---> from now on, 1V1 and TECNOTV are not available anymore, but OSF seems to not update its opinion on the TV accessibility and will display it anyway
 * IF the user just simply opens the TV package again (without changing anything), OSF updates again and will correctly NOT display it

This is something we cannot fix and still need a change from OSF.;;;","13/Jun/24 3:31 PM;ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com;[~tobias.pohlmann@vodafone.com]  I am not able to get your comment

But after the changes in PORPDT-345, this behaviour now _is_ okay and exactly what we want.

 

The new problem is ""first book TV -> then book KIP -> access details for TV ARE displayed -> {*}NOT OK{*}""

Thank you for the re-test.

The failure in case 2, where the technician option for KIP is wrongly displayed, is again the OSF bug discussed further below:
- when you book KIP first, then OSF calculates the technician option it wants to show for KIP, which is for a pure KIP order on an self-install address currently ""Anschluss ist sehbereit"".

- when you then book TV, it will not update the technician option it wants to show for KIP, and just show it regardless.

- when you just simply open the KIP package after the TV selection again, OSF _will_ update its opinion and not show the KIP technician section.

We cannot do anything here on our side and would need a fix from TechM side, so that OSF will always update both the TV and KIP technician section, no matter which package is currently opened.

 

About the ""Verbindungsdaten speichern"" field I don't know much unfortunately --neither how it is controlled nor what the desired logic behind it is.;;;","01/Jul/24 7:53 PM;ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com;[~tobias.pohlmann@vodafone.com]  we see a mismatch in behavior in case we book Broadvision KIP or different KIP 

For broadvision KIP its working as described by Timo Russo


Book BV KIP first, then TV -> section for technician is not displayed ->  {color:#00875a}*OK*{color}
Book other KIP first, then TV -> section for technician is displayed -> {color:#de350b}*NOT OK*{color}

{color:#de350b}*Can you confirm that for other KIP then BV also section for technician should be removed?*

{color:#172b4d}Its not about booking TV first, and then KIP. We handle this use case separately, we are aware that there might be an issue.
*But for now we only want to understand the behavior for  [[PORPDT-345]|https://de.jira.agile.vodafone.com/browse/PORPDT-345]*{color};;;","02/Jul/24 3:06 PM;tobias.pohlmann@vodafone.com;Hi, Ariadne,

{*}{color:#de350b}yes, I can confirm that in any case where we book KIP + TV (no matter if Broadvision or not, no matter which order we book it in), no technician section should be shown{color}{*}. 

The reason why this fails is as I tried to point out in my comment below. It really is pretty confusing, I apologize for that. I had a call with Natasa where I explained the problem, because it really is a bit hard to grasp.

So again in case of Broadvision what happens is:
 - [In the KIP package] KIP is booked, TV Connect is added because of Broadvision ---> OSF understands that no section for KIP should be shown because KIP + TV is booked and remembers that

 - [In the TV package] TV Digital is booked ---> OSF understands that no section for TV should be shown because KIP+TV is booked

==> no KIP or TV technician section is shown

In case of Not-Broadvision:
 - [In the KIP package] Only KIP is booked, but not TV yet ----> OSF supposes that a technician section should be shown for KIP (because only KIP is booked) and remembers that
 - [In the TV package] TV Digital + TV Connect is booked ----> OSF understands that no section for TV should be shown because KIP+TV is booked, but doesn't update the reasoning for KIP

==> technician section is shown for KIP, but not for TV;;;","09/Jul/24 5:42 PM;natasa.dimovic1@vodafone.com; ** There was a change on PCAT side: [[PORPDT-345] BV - Removal of Ready-to-Watch (Sehbereitschaft) Section - DE Jira (vodafone.com)|https://de.jira.agile.vodafone.com/browse/PORPDT-345]

 * which products exactly control the display of the tv access details in OSF?

 ** Is this controlled by special tags on products or categories, or are the products hardcoded in OSF?
Maybe [~vikash.saurav@vodafone.com] can answer this question?
 * If the display of the checkout part is only controlled by TECYESTV and TECNOTV, this will not work (and from cable side never should have) for Unity, since these two products are not aligned and should never be available for Unity.
Which TV technician option should be bookable in Unity TV scenarios? As far as I am aware there is no TV technician product that is available in the Unity footprint.

 * 
 ** we have a list of ~80 test cases. Some of these are apparently not correct.

If we are following the below steps in ACC2 then we are able to see the Access details even now:

Steps:

1)select TV Product and KIP section 

2)select the TV Product

3)Donot select any product in KIP

4)Move forward it will throw an error that we have to select the KIP Product in check out section

5)Go back and select the KIP Product now

6)Move forward and fill customer details

7)Then we are able to see the access details for TV

Note:we tried this steps 3 to 4 times and we are able to see the access details once

[~devi.jampana@vodafone.com] for now I would ignore the case you had and focus on the scenario described in the ticket: a TV order without KIP.
I think my initial question is still unanswered:
When does OSF show the access details section for TV in a unity scenario?

If the answer to this question is ""when at least one product in the technician_needed_no or technician_needed_yes category is visible according to the cable product logic"" then the next question we need answered is why was the section shown in previous versions?

""It is hard to give an exact timing for this feature since it seems to have been implemented a long time ago. I recommend contact with Vodafone BA for more information.
Unity Media works exactly the same as normal Kable TV and KIP products to display the access details section."".
To me this is a direct conflict to the information that this ever worked in the (recent) past.

For that TV product we are able to see the Access details

Could you please check that

 ;;;","17/Oct/23 3:05 PM;simon.auch@vodafone.com;Hi Devi,

I have no clue what OSF is doing here, but definitely not how it should behave to the best of my knowledge.
I could reproduce the issue and make the following two screenshots:
!image-2023-10-17-11-31-41-319.png!
!image-2023-10-17-11-32-04-497.png!

Which shows that OSF thinks that 1V1/VP0/TECYESTV/TECNOTV should be selected. That is not correct since the last execution of the cable product logic up to that point in the checkout process returns none of these 4 products as visible.
For completeness I attached the log of the session up to the dropdown in the checkout: [^cable_rules_artifact_OS42066.log]

Please find out when the access details are shown in the checkout. All information until now seems to conflict with the unity case. Maybe there is a special handling for unity addresses hardcoded in OSF?;;;","19/Oct/23 11:57 AM;ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com;Hi [~simon.auch@vodafone.com]  

regarding ""All information until now seems to conflict with the unity case"" -> for CR716 we have raised also defects for VKD and not only for Unity, so something is in general wrong in this access details section.

As the latest observation happened after having new broadvision product catalogue in place, should we raise a defect against CR756? Or against Product catalogue?
I do not want to mix this defect here with behavior shown for broadvision products, otherwise will be even more confusing;;;","19/Oct/23 1:20 PM;simon.auch@vodafone.com;Hi Ariadne,
maybe it was not clear what I meant with ""All information until now seems to conflict with the unity case"":
 * We have multiple answers (in this ticket and in other tickets) saying that TECNOTV and TECYESTV control the display of the section (and did so in the past)

 * 
 ** this can't be the case for unity as those are not aligned products
 * In other answers it was mentioned that it is controlled not by TECNOTV and TECYESTV but by categories containing TECNOTV, TECYESTV, 1V1, VP0
 ** sound better, but also all of these products are not aligned and should never have been orderable for unity

In the newly encountered behaviour by Devi (https://jira.sp.vodafone.com/browse/OS-42066?focusedId=2974883&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels:comment-tabpanel#comment-2974883) suddenly the access details are shown. Even though TECNOTV , TECYESTV, VP0, and 1V1 are not bookable according to cable product logic?

Someone has to look into the OSE source code and check _systematically_ when this section is shown. I expect there to be _something_ hardcoded for VFW, but I cannot check that myself.

Without an explanation from OSE side when this section is shown I don't know how else to help with this defect. If it is supposed to be based on the orderability of specific categories {_}then the new behaviour is a OSE contradicts it because no product from that category is orderable in the scenario clicked by me{_}. So for starters this could be analysed and maybe we get some insight which logic we are missing from OSE.  

I would not open another defect for this observation.;;;","23/Oct/23 5:21 PM;ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com;we have agreed that general analysis of CR716 defects regarding installation logic is required.

ali;;;","15/Dec/22 8:01 PM;heike.eisenlohr1@vodafone.com;I think this bug was created when we did not receive any status updates due to some misconfiguration in the weborder DB. We fixed that configuration issue on Nov 8 (WeborderDBRelease 2190.2022.11.00.03). 
Since then it should work, also for manually approved orders since the weborder ID should be sufficient to get an order status.
Does the error still occur? If yes, do you have example orders? ;;;","16/Dec/22 2:06 PM;ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com;as per latest Discussion with Daniel, the customer ID is relevant to get the status. But for manual approved orders the customer id is not available in a short time. But if helpful we can create another order.... it would be great if issue is solved, because it is there since months.
At the same time we received order status completed for all orders which got auto approved.

 

[~singireddy.reddy@vodafone.com]  can you please create a new customer order on ACC1 for unitymedia which would force manual approval? You can place an order on an adress where the same IBAN is already used, and same customer name. Then it will come to manual approval.

Created 2 orders that went into manual.
We got them approved, one as a new customer order, one as an existing customer order. (this doesn't change the status, it remains open)
We got them closed (this changes the status)
The status closed was picked up by the UOTracker and is also visible from OSF (This means that we didn't find a bug)

Our current best guess from looking at the screenshots is that: in that case the order was only approved and not closed and as such the order status didn't change, so there was nothing to show in OSF.;;;","11/May/23 4:47 PM;ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com;[~singireddy.reddy@vodafone.com]  can you please run one test case again on ACC1 with manual approval?

Step 1: Once the order is transferred to the backend, order should be in progress in ordermanager

Step 1: Complete the order (execute as new customer order) and check if it gets completed in frontend order manager

Please check as well if the customer id is transferred back to OSF

1) in case the order is auto approved, we immediately get back the customer ID from unity backend, and it works fine

2) in case the order is manual approved after some time, somehow a second ""update"" is missing, which would return the customer ID 

But through all the discussions it was stated it should not be a problem in this area. I still feel that this gap is somewhere in this process.

this is the reason why oneDMS call is failing.;;;","27/Nov/23 4:28 PM;ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com;The discussion in the beginning of this defect and my understanding all the time:

In case order is auto approved, customer ID is immediately given back to VKD Gateway
In Case order is NOT auto approved but later manually, there is no new call to get the customer ID -> thats why its not available

But in between it was mentioned that this is not the issue - as its working for retail, its strange that not working for Telesales.

Please note that OneDMS is handling Telesales Unity like VKD for Contract Summary Archiving. Not sure if relevant.

We got the information that for Auto approval orders we can see the customer number and Unified Order ID ,so success status is reflecting in OSF

Hi All,
Thank you all for joining the call!!
 
Please find the final Action points below from our call today:
 
	1. [~nina.pickl@vodafone.com] and [~rohan.kumbhar@vodafone.com] have discussed with [~simon.auch@vodafone.com] regarding this defect.
	
Action Point:

	1. [~nina.pickl@vodafone.com] will check with [~ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com] and update the defect. If required then CR will be raised.


;;;","07/Dec/23 1:51 PM;nina.pickl@vodafone.com;Updates:

 

OGW needs the customer number in case Unity Manual Approval Orders in Telesales and Retails, which should be provided from VKD to OGW within the existing FulfillmentStarted Request.

 

The customer number is atm provided only for Auto Approval Orders, but missing for Manual Approval orders, therefore the document cannot be archived and the OGW processing remain in status pending (the VKD status is SUCCESS but the orders don't get Sucecss status in OSF Fronend):

An error was encountered while invoking ScanView-SaveDocument WS. Details [Error_Code: HTTPOutbound_0001, Error_Message: Received a fault from processing server for service '/ScanView-001/SaveDocument': An invalid number format or number value was encountered.

Note: Retail Manual Approval Orders don't have this issue because the call to oneDMS/Customernumber is not needed for the E2E flow. They get the Status Success.

 

As the customer number has not been sent for Manual Approval Order until now, a new PST change is required.

I will take the topic with me and check if we can request this change at the PST CAT train, Team Ash(Benjamin Sachse) or Nora.

 

The new requirement should contain following information:
 * no difference between retail and telesales from cable perspective
 * example set status messages received by OSF
 * fulfilment started from manual approval 
 * fulfilment started from automatic approval 


 * explanation on
 * what you clicked to create the manual approval order
 * how to approve the manual approval order

Will update here once it is clear how to process with the new change.;;;","18/Dec/23 3:04 PM;nina.pickl@vodafone.com;In Progress by PST Ash Team, corresponding Jira Ticket in PST Jira:

[~simon.auch@vodafone.com] 

Elango performed the same flow on the both environments ACC1/test2b and ACC2/test3b- on ACC2/test3b worked fine, but not on ACC1/test2b.

Can you please check if the fix is available on test2b or what can be the reason otherwise?

 ;;;","01/Feb/24 4:26 PM;simon.auch@vodafone.com;So, the obvious difference between test3b (working) and test2b (not working) is that on test3b the status update is a `COMPLETED_SUCCESS` while on the test2b it is a `IN_PROGRESS_FULFILLMENT_STARTED`.

It can be seen that the unity order tracker on the test2b does not trigger any more updates for the order after the one with the status OPEN (for which we already have a customer ID as seen in the log).

I checked the test2b database contains the UME_ORDER_STATUS 'COMPLETED', which is correct, but apparently not written by the unity order tracker. Maybe there is a race condition between the unity order tracker and some other service that tries to write this field? This would also explain why it only happens sometimes.;;;","01/Feb/24 4:47 PM;nina.pickl@vodafone.com;[~elango.durairaj@vodafone.com]  Can you please check if the test2b order was successfully approved AND closed in Unity Backend?

 

Thanks [~simon.auch@vodafone.com] 

Was it not agreed/ implemented, that the customer number should be transferred in fullfilment started status?
h2. Desired Situation:

That's why a change is needed that the customer number is transferred to OGW in the *fulfilment started status* message from VKD.;;;","01/Feb/24 5:19 PM;elango.durairaj@vodafone.com;[~nina.pickl@vodafone.com]  785791 ACC1 , test2b,  order was successfully completed in unity backend without any issue.

My assumption right now is, that the ""lost"" updates before where due to the environment issues on VFW side and we actually only have the issue of updates that are send by another VKD system that are not supposed to be sent for VFW orders.;;;","27/Mar/24 4:08 PM;ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com;[~simon.auch@vodafone.com]  I am not really sure if I understand your comment correctly.

So you mean that we have to retry it once again because backend might had some problems?

The ""lost"" updates most likely were due to the environment issues on VFW side, or at least we cannot reproduce them anymore since they have been fixed.
The problematic updates sent to OSF by other cable systems that are missing the customer ID, should not happen anymore.

For some reason the unity system did not create an ""order"" (compared to the ""pending order"") in this case. This however seems to be a general problem on the UAT06 right now. I asked Mirko Saviano for some input regarding this.

;;;","31/May/24 7:16 PM;simon.auch@vodafone.com;According to Mirko Saviano:
""As I learned now, that someone currently stopped the approval job in Cablemaster. Perhaps that is the reason""
In addition it was turned off by asmitha.gayam@vodafone.com if needed it must be discussed with here to have it turned back on (or to figure out how long it stays disabled). Please get in contact with her to find out when the approval job is enabled again.
