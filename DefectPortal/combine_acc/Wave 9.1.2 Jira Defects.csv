-----------------

TechM: 

The purpose of the CR is to have same delivery details(delivery address + delivery date) if we have multiple Cable packages in the order.

System will show the UI of capture delivery method details only for first package and for the rest of the cable packages in the order it will show the package name only.

There are no changes on wish date, it will remain as is

-------------

Earlier we had this CR but it got removed from Software and probably therefore we do not see any other values in the dropdown for the wish date for UM

It seems OGW is missing to send areaCode to Backend and therefore we are getting this error.

OGW dosent know how the LTE backend is working or which values it need to validate.
what Affan had mention is that we are sending the values that Omnius is sending to OGW.
if areaCode or PhoneNumber is missing from the OGW request its because Omnius didnt send it to OGW.
you need to check with Marko which tag is missing from the request and then check with Omnius why they are not sending it to OGW;;;","24/Dec/24 12:07 PM;gaurav.lanjewar1@vodafone.com;[~marco.abraham01@vodafone.com]  will be back on 8th Jan then only we can check with him.

Hi all,

 

concerning the logic of providing the parameter in the service availability call for existing customers:
 # If a TASI exist for the customer this one has to be provided (which works currently)
 # If no TASI is found (which is the case for all LTE customers) the existing phone number has to be send -> to be provided as phonenumber

           2.1 And in addition the ONKZ value -> to be provided as areaCode

 

The part 2.1 seems to be missing

 

During the first waves we had the discussion how the parameters should be filled

 

Please check if the parameter is already missing in Omnius or only on OGW side.

 

Regards,

Marco

i think i can see the issue.

wehn you are sending: <ExistingCustomerTN>021154476783</ExistingCustomerTN>

OGW will take this as phone number without the 0.

but Marko also mention: If no TASI we need phone number and area code.

currently OGW only send phone number becasue area code is missing from the request.

this is the request:

We are testing the functionality of CR 804 and observed that Barcode are not getting generate for Cable and Mobile in retail channel 

Ref Link:  [https://jira.sp.vodafone.com/browse/FAST-801] 

Steps to produce:

1)Login into Retail channel 
2Perform ACQ/ILS flow 
3)submit order 
4)Barcode checks  

 

Test data:

Cable ACQ:

Omnius ID: 454891

OGW ID: 30047771

Mobile ILS:

Omnius ID: 454795

OGW ID: 30047639

 

*Expected Result:* Barcode should be generated for Mobile and Cable in both Retail and Telesales channel

*Actual Result:* barcode it getting generated for telesales but not for Retail Channel 

 

Note:  Before deployment of CR 804 barcode was generating for Mobile and Cable in both channel So this is side effect of CR 804 

Barcode for CAB and MOB is no more required so in future enhancement CR will come to delete the Barcode IDs from MOB and CAB stack.

Hi [~ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com] [~natasa.dimovic1@vodafone.com] 

Based on further analysis it is identified that issue is also part of production build , not part of any recent delivery towards ACC and there is no clue that it was working before as well.

And there is no change on price calculations recently and so it takes time to identify the root cause, our primary suspect is that it can be PCAT issue.

Note: The problematic product is added by sales rule and if we add the product manually the price show correctly.;;;","18/Dec/24 1:53 PM;ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com;If you need any PCAT support for analysis just reach to them out directly and do a session to investigate;;;","20/Dec/24 12:52 PM;vikash.saurav@vodafone.com;As discussed with [~sandeepkumar.pradhan@vodafone.com] we will deliver in next available slot to Production on January based the delivery defect count as agreed VF.  ;;;","07/Jan/25 6:20 PM;atharva.paskanthi@vodafone.com;Hello Vikash Saurav, Vodafone (External), could you please check and update ETA for this ticket;;;","08/Jan/25 1:12 PM;vikash.saurav@vodafone.com;will deliver on 29.01 or post 9.1.2 minor release .what ever is earlier;;;","08/Jan/25 2:34 PM;ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com;on 29th of January there is no delivery to ACC1- production fixes are in freeze as on 5th of February ACC3 release is going live;;;","10/Jan/25 3:44 PM;vikash.saurav@vodafone.com;Sandeep Pradhan added a comment -

what modification we did ? and why it was not correct in the initial fix delivery ?

also after restart or redeployment.

its not related to router.
we didnt need TID team because its not change we need to do for every restart.

Following the implementation of the new Barcode CR, the router SOS functionality is not working correctly.
 
Before the CR, the barcode contained the ogwOrderId, which allowed the router to identify the environment to which the order belongs.
 
After the CR, the barcode no longer includes the ogwOrderId, preventing the router from determining the correct environment for the order.;;;","27/Nov/24 7:15 PM;ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com;We have discussed about two possible solutions

1) Full solution -> needs full deployment to all ACC environments, and more complex implementation

2) Patch for ACC1 and ACC2, which ensures that status with new sequence is routed directly to ACC3 and ignoring ACC1, ACC2

For now, second option is preffered to not impact ACC1, ACC2 that much and to have fast solution. Ran is going to prepare relevant patches

Around 5th of February we need permanent full solution for all ACC; once CR804 is going to be merged on ACC1, ACC2 as well. This needs to be organized and monitored ;;;","28/Nov/24 7:56 PM;prachi.wadhavane@vodafone.com;Hi ,

DB Size
Observed that ITROMDB is significantly larger than PRROMDB. Despite the size difference,there is no noticeable impact on performance.

DB Configuration
Compared the configurations, both databases have identical configurations, including software versions and patches.

SGA (System Global Area) 
Compared SGA components such as shared pool, buffer cache, and redo log buffer, including their sizes and configurations. All components are  same in both database.

Gather Stats Status for Specific Tables
Checked statistics gathering status for tables OM_REPORTING_IN, OM_REQUEST,EA_REQUEST,OM_REQUEST,OM_ORDER,OMS_RENDERRESULT,OM_REPORTING_OUT and OM_ORDER. Include details on when stats were last gathered and their current status. All table stats are up to date and no table found in stale_stats status

While placing order from Omnius front end, Agent is capturing Mr or Mrs values as salutation along with Customer Name & Company Name in customer data section and same has been sent to OGW in submit order request.

But when OGW is sending Activation Request (Json Request) towards Cable backend (VKD), It's not sending Salutation in input request.

Due to this issue, VKD system is adding FIRMA as a salutation for this request in backend but When customer is activated in backend and agent tries to perform in-life sales flow on same customer, Omnius asking to select value for salutation field.

As discussed - Omnius is having only Mr & Mrs values for Cable SOHO customer in checkout & VKD backend is having only FIRMA value for salutation in backend for Legal customer.

where previously we able to search with this format -- - 81927 Munchen gottfried 15 ---

and address search was working but

now since tuesday 14th May we have to enter addresses in detail -- 81927 munchen gottfried-benn-str. 15 

 

And if we are missing any single character to add we get error ""No Address Found""

 

Steps to Reproduce:

1) Login to Telesales/ Retail and perform Service availability check

2) enter address in format : 81927 - Munchen- Gottfried- 15 this will give error  and 

using this format 81927 - Munchen - Gottfried-benn-str.-15 this will work 

 

Expected Result:

Only entering 81927 - Munchen- Gottfried- 15 should also give the result of address without auto suggestion.

 

Actual Result:

currently we have to use the detailed address to search the same. and if we are missing any single character we are getting error as ""NO Address Found""
