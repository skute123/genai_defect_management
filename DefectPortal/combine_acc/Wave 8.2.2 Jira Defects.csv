Hi [~krishnkumar.satpute@vodafone.com] 
I see this use case where there is no hardware selected ( Mobile Hardware) in the screenshot.

Also there is no change for IMEI. IMEI should be captured manually either cart contains HW or NO HW. It has no relation with HW / tariff. This field has to be captured for both type of insurance products VODAFONE_COVER and VODAFONE_COVER_PLUS

Artikel Number for both insurance product (VODAFONE_COVER and VODAFONE_COVER_PLUS) is clearly stated in Userstory that ,
if the cart does not have Mobile HW then Artikel number field will be editable ( ie. it should be added manually ) & vice versa ( ie. if there is Mobile HW in the cart then Artikel number is pre-filled) 
Note : Valid Artikel numbers are present in mobilehardware.csv so these values are pre-filled from PCAT 



This is invalid defect

I am already working the same issue under Z_INC02722367A.
Hence rejecting this as a Duplicate ticket.;;;","02/May/24 4:13 PM;satish.dhere1@vodafone.com;*Z_INC02722367A BSS42 || IT || KBA Regression: Order stuck at OMS Send in OPM*

 

08.01.2024 21:30:44 rohini.marathe1 TEMS_FN_PUNE
Solution Category: DB Configuration issue

We have checked and found all the OMS process were not in active state.

Also as per the earlier issues we asked deployment team to check the configuration as that issue got resolved after changes in configuration.

Old issue Mail Sub:-AW: BSS42 || IT || Gretchen: Order is getting stuck at OMS-warte-Antwort in OPM || Z_INC02708882A


Meanwhile we got a request from Peter for the OMS_DB_JAVA_CONNECT parameter of OPM in PR and IT environment. 

Peters Comments:
These connection parameters are still configured to use SID but this needs to be changed to use Service Name instead.
-Background of my request: For security reasons we had to replace our previous interface database (11gR2) in the VIP-lab SOC test environments by a newer one (19c) and now we can provide only the Service Name for connecting to it. All other parameters like IPs, ports, username and password have not been changed and can use as before.
So for OPM PR environment the OMS_DB_JAVA_CONNECT parameter is set to

jdbc:oracle:thin:@10.0.51.90:1521:soconlidb

but needs to be changed to

jdbc:oracle:thin:@10.0.51.90:1521/soconlidb.vfcs.net

For OPM IT environment it is set to

jdbc:oracle:thin:@10.0.51.90:1521:soconlrdb

but needs to be chamged to

jdbc:oracle:thin:@10.0.51.90:1521/soconlrdb.vfcs.net


As requested above we have raised CCR with deployment team and successfully made the required changes.

 

After changing JDBC connectivity details we are facing below error in OPM 93 adapter logs.

As per update from Peter and he has changed the SOC DB configuration to Old Interface DB now.

then as checked all OMS process were in active state over IT OPM GUI.

We have asked testing to retest with new order and as per their update Order reaches to final state.
Issue is resolved now, answering the ticket from TEMS end.

 ;;;","26/Apr/24 5:32 PM;thomas.jerke@vodafone.com;Hi,

ILS *with* Hardware is *not* possible. This only works with VVL (Contract Prolongation).

If you book Cover insurance for a subsided (with phone tariff) up to 120 days after last subsidy/contract prolongation the agent must be able to chose between all cover options and look manually for the correct price dependent on the hardware of the customer. The filter of the Cover options only works, if hardware is in shopping cart, which is not possible for ils.;;;","29/Apr/24 12:29 PM;nina.pickl@vodafone.com;Hi [~thomas.jerke@vodafone.com] ,

ok thanks, then following behavior will be possible:
 * for ILS *with* HW < 120 days - > SIM-Only rule appears, because no HW is added to the shopping card- all 10 insurance will be shown. Agent will be able to insurance 1. the existig HW from Tariff OR *2. other old HW purchased by Vodafone(just like in SIM-Only case)*

(for 2. I guess Agent instructions will be required if it should not be allowed for ILS with HW to ensure a different old (not from the Tariff) HW purchased by Vodafone. I will claify this with Adrian & Erik)

 
 * for ILS *with* HW > 120 days - > no insurance option should be shown.
 * for VVL with Device -> 2 insurance options will be shown depending on HW price.

 

Can you confirm if this is the expected behavior from your side as well?;;;","29/Apr/24 5:40 PM;nina.pickl@vodafone.com;Hi all,

after clarification with Adrian:

In Case ILS with HW up to 120 days- as the new tariff is always without HW, all 10 Cover/Cover Plus options should currently be visible in the ILS Use Case, including a link to the look-up page (like current behavior on the ACC3) -> [~krishnkumar.satpute@vodafone.com] we can close the Bug as WAD.

Additionally I'm in clarification if we need an instruction for the Agents in PROD, because Agent will not only be able to insurance the existig HW from Tariff but also to ensure an old HW purchased by Vodafone(like in SIM-Only case) -> But this is no longer part of this bug, so we can close this Bug.;;;","29/Apr/24 7:17 PM;krishnkumar.satpute@vodafone.com;Hi All

The 120 days rule is only valid for ""Paket ändern"" (ILS). In this case VF Cover Insurance can only be booked for existing hardware and this should be not possible after 120 since last contract prolongation.

If no new hardware, then option is not visible after 120 days

Therefore the behavior of this use case here is OK

About behavior in case of ILS (Paket ändern) we will check outside of the defect here and raise new defect in case we observe problems;;;","03/May/24 12:34 PM;priyanka.dhumal@vodafone.com;[~prachi.wadhavane@vodafone.com]  and [~taher.golvala@vodafone.com]  Can we recheck and close the defect as per the below comment from Ari. ;;;","03/May/24 2:29 PM;taher.golvala@vodafone.com;As discussed yesterday VVL is not the expected flow to check if we are performing scenario cannot book insurance >120 from the day of sales.

Hi Rohan, hi all,

yes – but we need permanent fix for each environment. To think about turning it off all the time when deployments happen is not easy when handling 3 ACC.

Therefore we track the permanent solution for ACC3 also with tracking ticket.

Thanks and regards, *Ari*

Hi Gokul,

we already have updated the Debug mode in OGW for ACC3—issue shall be resolved now

Thanks,

Test data:

Browser: Chrome
Environment: ACC1 
Channel: Telesales + Retail

Steps to reproduce the issue:
 - Enter address: Goethestr. 27 26409 Wittmund Wittmund
 - Select package: ""Kabel Internet & Phone""
 - Select tariff: ""[3BV:B09] GigaZuhause 250 Kabel, 1.-9. Monat 19,99 €""
 - Select goody on ""Gutschriften und Aktionen"" section: ""[JL5] Gutschrift GigaZuhause Young: 1.-9. Monat: 0 €, 10.-24. Monat: -5 €, danach 0 €""
 - open basket

The prices are not calculated as expected.
As a consequence of the wrong basket also the contract summary is incorrect.

!image-2024-04-10-18-00-56-136.png|width=856,height=463!  

+Pre-Analyses of product configuration team:+
OSF uses the 'Price sliding' field from the Product Catalog to configure the way the price periods are shown in the frontend:

!screenshot-1.png|width=338,height=226!

The numbers in this field are however interpreted as absolute points in time. They should however be interpreted as relative time intervals.

+Concretely this means:+

Price sliding '9:6:' should be interpreted as 0.-9. month, 10.-15. month, 16. month onward.
Currently it is interpreted as 0.-9. month, 0.-6. month, whatever comes afterward.
This obviously does not make any sense, since the second period ends before the first one, so the consequence in the frontend is, that the second period is ignored.

+The obvious fix therefore is:+
The numbers in the ""Price sliding"" field should always be interpreted as *relative time* intervalls.

 

+Additional proof:+
When checking in the OSF Backoffice for the product properties, the price_sliding of JL5 looks like this:

!image-2024-04-09-15-34-39-869.png!

Looking at this in overview in the frontend, the second time intervall seems to be ignored:

!image-2024-04-10-18-00-56-136.png|width=423,height=229!

Manually changing it to 15 then leads to the following view in OSF:

!image-2024-04-09-15-42-29-039.png|width=737,height=206!

This is, however, still wrong. OSF seems to tread the numbers in the PCAT import as absolute times instead of relative intervals

=> Three sliding prices are in principle possible to show, but the configuration in the product setup is imported and interpreted wrongly",,alka.kshirsagar2@vodafone.com,ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com,atharva.paskanthi@vodafone.com,gaurav.lanjewar1@vodafone.com,gokul.vade@vodafone.com,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,OAF-762,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"02/May/24 12:50 PM;stephanie.krammer@vodafone.com;OSF Incident Ticket - CRImprovement notwendig - OS-54646 OSF  ACC1  Wave 8.2  sliding prices are not interpreted as expected - Vodafone Global Jira.msg;https://jira.sp.vodafone.com/secure/attachment/1281954/OSF+Incident+Ticket+-+CRImprovement+notwendig+-+OS-54646+OSF++ACC1++Wave+8.2++sliding+prices+are+not+interpreted+as+expected+-+Vodafone+Global+Jira.msg","10/Apr/24 9:33 PM;stephanie.krammer@vodafone.com;image-2024-04-09-15-34-39-869.png;https://jira.sp.vodafone.com/secure/attachment/1267853/image-2024-04-09-15-34-39-869.png","10/Apr/24 9:34 PM;stephanie.krammer@vodafone.com;image-2024-04-09-15-42-29-039.png;https://jira.sp.vodafone.com/secure/attachment/1267854/image-2024-04-09-15-42-29-039.png","10/Apr/24 9:30 PM;stephanie.krammer@vodafone.com;image-2024-04-10-18-00-56-136.png;https://jira.sp.vodafone.com/secure/attachment/1267849/image-2024-04-10-18-00-56-136.png","11/Apr/24 12:55 PM;stephanie.krammer@vodafone.com;pcat-without-fix.tar.xz;https://jira.sp.vodafone.com/secure/attachment/1268028/pcat-without-fix.tar.xz","10/Apr/24 9:32 PM;stephanie.krammer@vodafone.com;screenshot-1.png;https://jira.sp.vodafone.com/secure/attachment/1267851/screenshot-1.png",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,The issue is a show stopper for the Go Live of Young Promotion feature which is planned for April Main Release 29.04,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,OS-49399,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"v9.18.5-BB1 2024-04-02 06:59 |04-09|21-54",Fixed with CR826 in Wave 9.2 release ,,Cable,,Omnius,ACC,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Green,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"0|i9j9qv:",9223372036854775807,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Backlog - UNCOVERED,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Code,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,TechM -> PCAT,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"11/Apr/24 11:55 AM;ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com;[~vikash.saurav@vodafone.com]  [~bharath.krishnamurthy@vodafone.com]  please check this on priority, if you need a call to discuss the details we can organize it but we need to be fast.

 ;;;","15/Apr/24 7:43 PM;atharva.paskanthi@vodafone.com;Comment from Vishank :

Hi All,

 

As discussed and suggested by Dev team in today’s meeting, need to update and add the value for below tags in *“property_env_ACC3.xml”* file for O2A WF module. (WF_1 & WF_2)  -- as executor message stuck in jms queue. (from defect bridge chat)

 

*In common section :-*

<WF_DISPATCHER_NUM>10</WF_DISPATCHER_NUM>

<WF_EXECUTER_NUM>50</WF_EXECUTER_NUM>

 

*In WF_1 & WF_2 sections :-* 

<JAVA_MEM_ARGS>-Xms5g -Xmx5g -XX:CompileThreshold=8000 -XX:MetaspaceSize=512m  -XX:MaxMetaspaceSize=512m -XX:SurvivorRatio=2 -XX:+UseParallelGC -XX:+UseParallelOldGC -XX:SurvivorRatio=4 -XX:TargetSurvivorRatio=90 -XX:-UseAdaptiveSizePolicy -XX:+DisableExplicitGC -verbose:gc -XX:+PrintGCTimeStamps -XX:+PrintGCDetails -XX:+HeapDumpOnOutOfMemoryError -Xloggc:./logs/gc.log -Djdk.tls.client.protocols=TLSv1</JAVA_MEM_ARGS>

 

The above-mentioned changes require redeployment and restart of ACC3 O2A WF module.

 

*Note :-* The change in above parameters in above mentioned file (property_env_ACC3.xml{*}){*} are specific to ACC3 environment only. Also, it depends on the resources available on the specific environment servers. (here deosa12vr & 13vr);;;","16/Apr/24 11:50 AM;nina.pickl@vodafone.com;Hi all, the Sanity test on ACC3 is completed successfully.

i schedule a call for tomorrow with the designer what to do with this conflict.;;;","02/Apr/24 3:20 PM;ran.farjun1@vodafone.com;Hi,

after a call with the team and designer we sent an email to [~kirill.leibov1@vodafone.com] and suggested to remove the implementation of CR604 for doc archiving flow because of the retry mechanism that already in place.

when we will get a response i will update here;;;","02/Apr/24 3:44 PM;kirill.leibov1@vodafone.com;I think, the CR604 was especially designed as the solution for eliminating all other retries by replacing them with a unique control mechanism.

Except, they are some additional criticality in this especial case.;;;","04/Apr/24 12:17 PM;ran.farjun1@vodafone.com;after [~kirill.leibov1@vodafone.com] response the team is in discussion on how to proceed with the solution for this issue.

 For CR604 currently it is disabled in production. Also DocArchieving is already implemented with old mechanism of retry (which is not yet removed). So it is requested not to add retry in error_handler for retry for this error.

 * Amdocs confirmed once that the introduction of CR604 will not affect the previous implementation (no CR604 configuration -> ""business as usual"").
 * CR604 was delivered without any initial configuration and even without the instructions how to apply this configuration.

As we are tracking two different issues in this current defect OS-52363 (OGWERR-9900 Archiving & EAI004064 - Used MSISDN) it might be confusing to leave the ticket open, although issue with error code EAI004064 is solved.

im checking with my team how to proceed.;;;","13/May/24 4:46 PM;ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com;[~ran.farjun1@vodafone.com]  [~laxmikant.agrawal@vodafone.com]  any update?;;;","15/May/24 6:31 PM;gaurav.lanjewar1@vodafone.com;Hi [~ran.farjun1@vodafone.com]  can you please share your input.;;;","15/May/24 9:53 PM;ran.farjun1@vodafone.com;Hi,

yes, currently the fix is almost ready after discussions with design team and Ketaki.

in this fix the 24 retry will not be in use anymore, instead the retry will be determined by the ogw_error_handler table.

it will decide how many times to retry, and how much time to wait between the calls.

for this flow the retry will be active for empty response from oneDMS or OGWERR-9900 error code return

for example:
this is a record from the table:

{
    ""ERROR_CODE"":""OGWERR-9900"",
    ""ERROR_CATEGORY"":""Technical"",
    ""IGNORE_ERROR_IND"":""N"",
    ""RETRYABLE_IND"":""TRUE"",
    ""MAX_RETRY_TIMES"":""3"",
    ""RETRY_WAIT_TIME"":""10"",
    ""MAX_WAIT_TIME"":null,
    ""STATUS_TO_SET"":null,
    ""CHANNEL"":""TELESALES"",
    ""SERVICE_CALL"":""ASYNC"",
    ""SERVICE_NAME"":""OneDMS""
}
so the flow will retry 3 times and the wait time will be 10 seconds between every try.;;;","16/May/24 4:05 PM;ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com;informed [~kirill.leibov1@vodafone.com]  to get in touch with Ran to discuss if the solution is ok from vodafone side;;;","17/May/24 1:34 PM;kirill.leibov1@vodafone.com;The existing solution with 24 tries must be {+}not removed{+}, but it shall remain as the +default+ behavior in the case, that we do not have no configuration in the ogw_error_handler table.;;;","19/May/24 1:34 PM;ran.farjun1@vodafone.com;thanks Kiril,

[~simon.auch@vodafone.com]  FYI - we get unexpected status response from VKD for old orders all the time, especially at night ;;;","03/Apr/24 5:05 PM;simon.auch@vodafone.com;The system on VKD site does not remember the full details of the last status update sent to OSF. In addition many state system on VKD side contains much more states than the few reported to OSF. For some of these state transitions if the source and target state both map to the same OSF state it would not surprise me that OSF gets ""duplicated"" status updates. These however are not incorrect since the order is in the state reproted.

I'm not familiar enough with the requirments for which these systems where implemented, but I would assume (especially since it behaves this way for years now) that it is to be expected that OSF might get the same update multiple times for orders.

Why these especially happen at night: maybe a side effect of some bulk jobs on VKD side.;;;","05/Apr/24 12:43 PM;atharva.paskanthi@vodafone.com;Hello [~eugen.berdyansky@vodafone.com] , [~rohan.kumbhar@vodafone.com] can you please provide your inputs;;;","05/Apr/24 2:25 PM;eugen.berdyansky@vodafone.com;[~atharva.paskanthi@vodafone.com]  the cable process of setOrderStatus worked in general [9:00 -16:00 normal working time], and hier we have some logical problem beetween SKY App. and another Stack.

Steps to reproduce for Telesales channel:

1) Enter unitymedia or VKD adress -> new customer
2) Add KUD product e.g. GigaTV Net, 1.{-}6. Monat 0,{-}€
3) move to checkout, fill in customer details > customer adress in Germany
4) reach to IBAN section, type in GERMAN IBAN e.g. DE20700500000003658888 (Any German IBAN can be taken!)
->IBAN validation is running and successfull
5) Select invoice adress as customer adress and do NOT select any different bank account holder
6) Klick on ""weiter"" and get error message

We are not using foreign customer adress or foreign IBAN, and also +*not*+ using foreign invoice adress or different bank account holder
It is not the problem, that its going to be validated if there is any data from foreign countries used! The validation itself is correct process - but the result is wrong! It has to be identified by the system, that this customer is allowed to pay the products so we are able to move to the next section.

 

It seems the booking works sometimes, and sometimes not. Or maybe only for specific constellation of KUD products it works. We need to investigate if there is an issue with the software or not

We have analyzed further and found that there is recent requirement over (https://jira.sp.vodafone.com/browse/OAF-690) [!https://bmcomviva.atlassian.net/images/icons/issuetypes/epic.svg!VFDED1FTS-5531: CR780 - Change of payment validation check for existing SEPA mandatIN DESIGN|https://bmcomviva.atlassian.net/browse/VFDED1FTS-5531] which is now available as part of the software where we are testing the above scenario.

Hi Ari,
 

As per the CR780 we are checking below conditions

Technically we have only these additional validation
 * KUD(Cable Independent package with product in category CABLE->giga_app_de) in cart

 * Its valid DE IBAN

 * Its bank account owner = legal contact

 * Its payer address = legal address

If all conditions meet then agent is allowed to continue.

 
*Customer legal contact & legal address* is what we capture or prefill on customer section of checkout

!b117ed88-4bda-47a3-8750-9f38f445a52f.png!

*Bank account owner (payer contact) & Bank account owner address (payer address)* is what we receive as part of *GetPayerAndPaymentInfoResponse* which is {{I1004_GetPayerAndPaymentInfo}} service response we are expected to receive for Cable packages in addition to {{I04_ConvertAndValidateIBAN}} *.*

*!468b5eec-eef3-4ba2-9939-4efeb1a62c8b.png!*

*Here in this scenario one of the condition is getting failed based on the check mentioned on CR780*
 * Its bank account owner = legal contact

 * Its payer address = legal address;;;","27/Feb/24 6:17 PM;ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com;[~vikash.saurav@vodafone.com] I think there is some logical error in the scenario.

1) if the IBAN is already existing in cable backend, it might be possible to give back information about the payer (CR780)

2) if its NEW IBAN, like here - how should cable backend know something about this payer? Its not existing in backend yet, will just be created with this new order - so the response has to be with empty data;;;","01/Mar/24 12:53 PM;gaurav.lanjewar1@vodafone.com;Hi [~bharath.krishnamurthy@vodafone.com]  Do we have any update on this.

Hi Ari,

After Yesterday call on  4-3-2024, with VF team and BA Thorsten

Conclusion of the call: user story improvement will be created by BA Kshitij.;;;","05/Mar/24 2:29 PM;ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com;We have discussed yesterday with Kshitij -> the actual requirement of CR780 was to compare data in the checkout itself, and not use any data from the cable backend for it. This was not concrete enough described in the requirement itself. 

When calling cable backend for unknown IBANS it cannot give any data back, and therefore the flow is blocked, as data entered in frontend is not matching to data coming back from cable backend (as its empty).

This is the answer from Raniero:

You need to check with OSF, this is what OSF is sending:
and OSF is sending a request for an UM customer (BW = Baden Württenberg).

This is a urn for a VKD customer:

!image-2024-02-07-12-08-44-486.png!

This is a urn for a UM customer:

!image-2024-02-07-12-09-00-539.png!

In SoapUI you are sending a request for a VKD customer, OSF sends a request for an UM customer.

Could you please check that again? Thanks;;;","07/Feb/24 5:33 PM;vikash.saurav@vodafone.com;Divya Kumbla added a comment -
 
 
Hi [~natasa.dimovic1@vodafone.com]  ,Again the decision of whether the customer is VKD or UM is based on AccountCategory in getCustomerResult for index search

and Region in retrieveCustomerInfo mode1 for Legacysearch.

For reference

!image-2024-02-07-17-32-45-292.png!

So we need to check what is coming for this customer for which you need to share the search response and mode1 response logs.;;;","07/Feb/24 6:06 PM;natasa.dimovic1@vodafone.com;Hi [~vikash.saurav@vodafone.com] please find attached the logs;;;","08/Feb/24 1:12 PM;vikash.saurav@vodafone.com;Divya Kumbla added a comment -
 
Hi [~natasa.dimovic1@vodafone.com] 

As said earlier the region from mode1 decides if its VKD or UM, and as per attached logs we receive region as UME-KBW hence OSE considers it as UM customer.

 * Values like ""AccountCategory"" in Omnius are derived from OGW: Here:- _AccountCategory_ in getCustomerResult for index search and _Region_ in retrieveCustomerInfo mode1 for LegacySearch.
 * As the ADDRESS REGION is in UM Area - it is treated as UM customer, even though he belongs to the VKD Stack

h4. _Possible SD option to be validated/proven:_ 
 * Derive customer stack from GlobalID prefix (""legacy stack"")  instead of address region
 * IF improvements required as this is only known by OGW (Omnius can only see LK_ from linked customers) - e.g. introducing new attribute to indicate customers product stack:
 * CustomerSearch()
 * getCustomerDetails()
 * [@Mitra, Gaurab, External Vendor|mailto:gaurab.mitra@amdocs.com]: We should investigate if further interfaces have to be considered (To be discussed on next CR meeting)

[@Kshitij.Srivastava@comviva.com|mailto:kshitij.srivastava@comviva.com]: To check UseCases in Omnius to be considered for an improvement

Hi [~ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com]  ,

I don't see the steps to reproduce and if its for existing customer we need mode logs and serviceability logs between OSE<->OIL & OIL<->OGW.

Thanks

[~alka.kshirsagar2@vodafone.com] fyi;;;","24/Jan/24 3:56 PM;ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com;[~vikash.saurav@vodafone.com]  I was not creating any order, I am just scanning portal UI tool from time to time to find unidentified issues. And within this quality check I have found tickets with this error message. 

 

After some analysis I have identified, that it seems to be this scenario:

-> Search existing unitymedia customer and perform Move to VKD adress 

 

this is example Order ID from ACC1 - it failed with 2 sky tickets

One ticket because of invalid VPKN (issue is solved, please ignore that) and second sky ticket was for setpermission.


Unfortunately Sky ticket were cleared in between so I am not able to find my two tickets anymore..... But hopefully you can reproduce on your environment for a Move from Unity to VKD.

Seems like in this case the existing customer ID from unity is taken over, instead of recognizing that customer will get a new customer ID from VKD for Move scenario

 

Order ID 782545, Customer ID 1009755201 (initial customer before Move) 

!image-2024-01-24-11-21-17-927.png!

 

Same seems to happen when moving from Unity Cable to DSL product. 

So please check flow Unity Cable to VKD Cable Move, and Unity Cable to DSL Move

 ;;;","25/Jan/24 5:24 PM;ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com;We have placed another order yesterday.

*Move from Unity Cable to VKD Cable* with permission selection in checkout.
Omnius Order ID 783467

 

In SetPermission Call I see that its called for Cable - {*}UN{*}, but the target customer is VKD Customer after Move. 



So I would expect in the setpermission call that system is calling VKD with new VKD customer ID, right? It does not make sense to store a permission in unitymedia backend when the customer is going to be inactive there, and will be active only in VKD in the future with new customer ID

Hi [~ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com]  ,

Further based on investigation above is the expected behavior. Which means for the existing customer we are getting the region value from Install Base and if region value which is from the IB or from the serviceability(in ACQ) is not matching with the below table data which is agreed during the design, then OSE send empty <CustomerList><CustomerDetails>{*}<TargetSystem>{*}.

If for any new region value VF expects to send *TargetSystem* value then it has to be added to OSE via SRT

 * Customers region value is received from Install Base (<CustomerList><CustomerDetails><{*}TargetSystem{*}>).
 * As this is a MOVE scenario, the IB Region value is from the former residence (which is VKD) of the customer and therefore does not match the future address (which is UM)

[~ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com] I think the behaviour by OSF that the error message is shown in case a inconsistent technician selection is made by the agent can be assumed to be correct. I at least would not know what the expected outcome of such a selection would be.

The following part from your comment could be the solution to this:
{panel}
*BUT this is not expected as per Ticket from PROD:*

This means the option for TV is not visible anymore, if I got it right. Therefore there can also not be any mismatch between TV and KIP installation options.

Your assumption regarding the TV section then not being visible is correct.

From our tests I would also assume that the TV section shouldn't be visible in this case [Quelle von vkdTechnicianOptions.feature - productSetup - webgit (kabeldeutschland.de)|https://webgit.kabeldeutschland.de/projects/FE/repos/productsetup/browse/4DevelopmentOnly/tests/unified/features/availability/vkdTechnicianOptions.feature#239-259]:

The product itself however does not seem to indicate that it has a price nor a non standard rate, both of which should however not be necessary for unity inventory products.

It is noteworthy that the product itself has no price configured in the product setup, maybe the display in the contract summary of OSF does not work if it is an inventory product without a price (and without a non standard rate actually configured in the product setup)?

The very first analysis was by me and as far as I can tell nothing in the comments suggests that the assumptions I had were analysed?

For the result of my analysis see the first comment [OS-47333] OSF Wave 8.1 ACC2 - Contract Summary: Price of old TV Product is missing (only OSF) - Vodafone Global Jira.

I also checked again for a random customer having this product that the inventory returned by vkdgateway does indeed contain a price.

TL;DR:

This behaviour is reproducible with a vast range of PCAT versions (basically any version containing UMDKLM should suffice).

The product has no price configured, but for (unity) inventory products the price from the inventory must be used. 
VkdGateway correctly returns a price in the inventory of the customer.

We had a call with TechM team to analyse this defect Further and got the below information from them

They compared the back office configuration between one failed scenario(Digitaler Kabelanschluss m. Service ) and pass scenario(Digital Kabelanschluss)

and made the below changes to their environment to check whether it is working with failed scenario:

 

*1.They tried to change the price of the failed product and product frontend visibilty of the failed product same as the Passed one*

i.e They changed the price of Digitaler Kabelanschluss m. Service from 0 to 20,99 in BO and product Visibility as below (Previously only inverntory is selected for thiis product)

And then when checked in front end , We are able to see the product details in front end 

 

*2. As we mentioned that price of the Unity Product should not be taken from Back Office*

To check this one , they tried to change one product price from 20,99 to 20 euros in back office in their environment 

When checked in front end , we are able to see the product price has changed from 20,99 to 20 Euros

[~devi.jampana@vodafone.com] 

As discussed there is no such handling for this usecase; where Overriding of PCAT price with Customer Ibase for any product.

In Omnius; it always consider customer’s Ibase product price from pcat RMM(reverse Multimapped) or via (service all {{{}GetNonStandardRates{}}})

So this is not a defect ruther i would say it must be CR to have such behaviour handle in Omnius.

Multiple things are interesting for this order:
 # Natasa did select VP0 in the checkout, but it is missing from the order.
 ## while testing another bug we noticed that the technician options might not be added to the order when the agent selects them in the dropdown.
 # In the IBP VP0 is added to the order because of the rule ""add_VP0_for_ENV_NE4_technician_install_address"" which (among other things) checks 
{code:java}
object installation type is technician-install {code}
(which should correspond to the ""sehbereitschaft"" selected in the OSF checkout)
In contrast to
{code:java}
object availabilities contains self-install {code}
(which should correspond to the address property self-install)

 # If VP0 is not properly added by the dropdown in the checkout as well as not being selected by the rule due to the object installation type not being processed correctly then it might explain why OSF does send WTXN*:
The rule ""modem_mapping_for_new_customer_at_selfinstall_address"" applies either to

 ## new kip customers that select kip + tv without VP0/1V1

 ## new kip customer without tv

 # The first case would be taken by OSF, thus replacing WTX15 with WTXN15. while the IBP will take neither of them, thus not replacing WTX15

I think the first step must be that OSE must analyse why VP0 is not added to the shopping cart when selecting it in the dropdown.

Additionally no cable product logic seems to be executed after the value in the dropdown is selected for the whole rest of the order process, I was under the impression that at least before the checkout overview the cable product logic should be executed again. It would be nice if this could also be checked.

Result: during the checkout I can select 1V1 as a TV technician and TECYESKIP as a KIP technician.
The logs indicate that 1V1 is never passed to cable product logic as selected.
I attached the log of the session.
[^cable_rules_artifact_OS44322.log]

The log should contain an entry like ""1V1|true"" which it does not.

I also reproduced the issue with the mock [Cable_Address_Type_NE4-VVO|https://ash-sb5-telesales.osf.paps-vf.de/agent/account/login?showProductCodes=true&TC_ID=Cable_Address_Type_NE4-VVO] which results in VP0 being selectable in the checkout. Again in the log we cannot find VP0 ever being passed to the cable product logic as selected.

[^cable_rules_artifact_OS44322_VP0.log]

At this point I think this is a OSF bug, since cable logic cannot control when and with which products it is called by OSF.;;;","29/Sep/23 2:20 PM;vikash.saurav@vodafone.com;h3. Kshitij Kumar Srivastava added a comment -

Visiblity in Order overview for product 1V1/VP0 is controlled by PCAT configuration and rules.;;;","29/Sep/23 3:00 PM;simon.auch@vodafone.com;Hi Vikash,
as the logs show the PCAT returns VP0 and 1V1 as visible in this case, so maybe we have a different understanding what ""visible"" in this case means?
My understanding of visible in this case is:
 * the last call of the cable rules plugin by osf returns a list of packages, each containing a list of products.
 * a product is ""visible"" for a dropdown if the property ""visible"" in the last return value of the cable rules plugin for this particular product was ""true"".

 ** this is especially distinct from the ""visibility"" of tariffs in the configurator which depends on more information like:
 *** is the product selected
 *** is it configured to be shown in the configurator
 *** is the product ""visible"" according to the last result of the cable rules plugin

*According to the logs 1V1/VP0 is visible in this case but is never selected by OSF even if the agent selects it in the dropdown*

This is even underlined by the fact that 1V1/VP0 are shown in the dropdown {*}which would not be the case if the were not ""visible""{*}.;;;","03/Oct/23 5:09 PM;dadasaheb.narbat@vodafone.com;Hi [~vikash.saurav@vodafone.com]  Could you please share latest update here and Chage status to InProgress. ;;;","05/Oct/23 1:15 PM;vikash.saurav@vodafone.com;h3.

This is missing because, according to our investigation, the product is never passed to the cable product logic in OSF, even if the corresponding dropdown is selected in the OSF checkout.

Hi [~vikash.saurav@vodafone.com] ,
thank you for the investigation.
According to our investigation we do not have any Compatibility Rules that deselect 1V1, and as said before 1V1 also never appears in the input to the cable rules plugin. 
Also check this previous comment for a log: https://jira.sp.vodafone.com/browse/OS-44322?focusedId=2949361&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels:comment-tabpanel#comment-2949361

As things stand there is nothing cable logic can do to deselect the product as the product is never select from the point of view of the cable product logic.

Please investigate on your side why 1V1 is never passed to CREP as selected once it is selected in the shopping cart/checkout.

Best regards

Simon;;;","10/Oct/23 4:24 PM;natasa.dimovic1@vodafone.com;Hi [~simon.auch@vodafone.com] if the root cause is the missing VP0/ 1V1, why in the bug OS-44216 no Sky Ticket is created.

Hi [~simon.auch@vodafone.com]  ,

This issue on Sky or Cable backend we talking above may be related to CR676. Check with VF as we don't have any implementation on OSE for CR676.

Also we have some discussions going on for CR676 with on [OS-44236] SIT1 | Retail/Telesales | CR676 | Cable order is failing with error JSON validation failure - Vodafone Global Jira

[~natasa.dimovic1@vodafone.com] fyi;;;","11/Oct/23 2:53 PM;simon.auch@vodafone.com;Hi Vikash,

I do not think it is related to CR676 as it has nothing to do with the json schema, but a change in that CR could of course have impacted OSE to behave differently. According to my knowledge however CR676 only had OGW impact until recently and should have no impact whatsoever on OSE and with which products OSE calls the cable product logic.

As I said before, from our perspective there is absolutely nothing cable can do about this *because we do not control with which products cable product logic is called by from OSE.*

*Please investigate in OSE why the cable product logic is not called with the product after it is selected in the checkout.* Before this is done there will be nothing we can do to help with this issue, so please refrain to assigning it back to me before this is investigated. If you have further question please set up a meeting with me.

Hi [~natasa.dimovic1@vodafone.com] 

As already mentioned you that this defect we have fixed on the rule level where the 1V1 was not sent as selected true. After fix this is sent as selected true to Cable artifact rule. Next Cable artifact process the input and send back final list which should be present in cart.

This can be verified by enabled Cable artifact rules on ACC and verify that 1V1 is sent on rules input for the package or not.

We can verify If we are sending 1V1 as true or false on artifact rule log file. If sending as true then plugin has to return the selected product back to OSE to keep that file in cart.

Please check and confirm;;;","09/Nov/23 5:41 PM;natasa.dimovic1@vodafone.com;Hi [~simon.auch@vodafone.com] could you please check the last comment?

the problem only seems to appear for addresses that allow 1V1 (instead of VP0).
One such address: Hagelstangestr. 30, München;;;","06/Dec/23 8:20 PM;simon.auch@vodafone.com;I further analysed this issue and found the following:

Orders created by OSF contain a field 
{code:json}
""apartmentDetails"":{""technicianNeeded"":
true/false
}
{code}
As far as I can tell from tests the field is always true if and only if the agent selected the technician_yes option in either the TV or the KIP dropdown during the checkout.

This information should also be passed to the cable rules plugin, in the field `IServiceAddress::technicianNeeded`.

After the selection of technician options in the dropdown the cable posting rules are executed again by OSF, but the the `technicianNeeded` field is not set to true (as it should be if the agent previously selected VP0/TECYESKIP in the technician dropdowns).

This can be checked by searching for `technicianNeeded` in the following log: [^cable_rules_artifact_OS44322_technicianNeeded.log] 
Notice that the last execution contains `TECYESKIP|true`, since the agent selected the kip technician to be necessary.

For fixing this bug the cable rules artifact logs can be used to check if the technician needed flag is passed to the cable rules plugin correctly.
In the meantime we will try to provide a workaround that might resolve most of the issues as well. We have an experimental workaround since version V2330_2024_01_00_032.
Until this issue is fixed on OSF side and we can remove our workaround again I would keep this ticket open however.;;;","15/Dec/23 3:43 PM;dadasaheb.narbat@vodafone.com;hi [~vikash.saurav@vodafone.com]  Please share latest update here. ;;;","18/Dec/23 11:18 AM;dadasaheb.narbat@vodafone.com;HI [~vikash.saurav@vodafone.com]  Please share latest update here. ;;;","28/Dec/23 6:42 PM;ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com;We have to check if mentioned workaround from Simon is present on ACC environment (and on which environment)

Okay, let me go through your message step by step.

For the first test case:
 * I can reproduce it :)
 * I think that only the TV dropdown is shown is correct (according to the up to now still best documentation we have: [Scenario dimension ""Technician appointment"" - OSF - Vodafone Global Confluence|https://confluence.sp.vodafone.com/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=103985437]).
 * I think VP0 being selectable is also correct (again according to above documentation, and to some tests we have [Quelle von vkdTechnicianOptions.feature - productSetup - webgit (kabeldeutschland.de)|https://webgit.kabeldeutschland.de/projects/FE/repos/productsetup/browse/4DevelopmentOnly/tests/unified/features/availability/vkdTechnicianOptions.feature#216-236]).
 * VP0 disappearing afterwards sounds problematic and without investigating I have no idea why it would.
 ** VP0 not being selected anymore however explains that my workaround doesn't work because it relied on the presence of the technician options instead of the flag.

For the second case:
 * I can reproduce the behaviour :)
 * I don't understand the problem with this though? For this particular example you can proceed either with no technician at all (TECNOKIP, TECNOTV are both selectable) or with a technician (TECYESKIP, 1V1 can be selected together).
 * If the issue is the error message, what would be the expected behaviour if a different technician selection would be made by the agent?
 * If the issue is that the TV dropdown is visible at all: that confuses me a bit as well, since our tests would indicate that only the kip options should be shown in this case: [Quelle von vkdTechnicianOptions.feature - productSetup - webgit (kabeldeutschland.de)|https://webgit.kabeldeutschland.de/projects/FE/repos/productsetup/browse/4DevelopmentOnly/tests/unified/features/availability/vkdTechnicianOptions.feature#239-259]

The answer why the whole section is missing can only be given by OSF.

If I had to guess I would assume OSF is hardcoded to check for TECYESKIP, TECNOKIP, UMTECKIP:NOO, UMTECKIP:YES. One of the relevant tests in our test suite is likely:
{code:java}
    Scenario: New cable TV (KAA) and KIP customer without self-install on NE4-VVO address
        Given a KDG service address where ""analog and digital"" TV is available with object category ""NE4-VVO""
        And a KDG service address where internet with data transfer rate ""1000"" is available
        And self-install is 'not available'
        And a selection
            | productCode |
            | TC2         |
            | 01H:B06     |
        When I get the availability and basket
        Then the products have the states
            | productCode  | state         |
            | TC2          | selected      |
            | 01H:B06      | selected      |
            | TECNOKIP     | not available |
            | TECYESKIP    | not available |
            | TECNOTV      | not available |
            | TECYESTV     | not available |
            | VP0          | selectable    |
            | 1V1          | not available |
            | UMTECKIP:NOO | not available |
            | UMTECKIP:YES | not available | {code}
According to my understanding no kip technician is needed at VVO addresses since the TV technician will handle the installation.
As with the other bug tickets I think we need clarification from business what the expected behaviour is.

Thank you!;;;","21/Sep/23 1:42 PM;simon.auch@vodafone.com;Hi Natasa, just for my understanding: what is the impact of not booking VP0?
As far as I understand the relevant BI order for TV is created anyway, right?
It's just that the customer might not get an information on the CS/confirmation letter that a technician will be sent out?

I think this is a cable bug, [~benjamin.sachse@vodafone.com] can you prioritize this in our backlog?;;;","21/Sep/23 1:49 PM;natasa.dimovic1@vodafone.com;Hi [~simon.auch@vodafone.com] yes, I think the only impact is, that the customer does not see this information in the CS. I'm not sure if it is also an impact, that ANS is not booked, if VP0 is booked. If VP0 would be booked, then ANS is also booked.

 ;;;","21/Sep/23 5:30 PM;simon.auch@vodafone.com;*Guess:* 
Cable product logic tries to rebuild the selection of the agent in each step. This means that certain clickflows are not really supported.

If their are for example two products A and B, A is visible, B is not, selecting A replaces A with B.
If the agent now selects A, A will be added to the selection and the product logic will replace it with B, the agent will see B in the selection.
If the cable product logic is executed again B is not a valid selection because it is not visible.

In this case A would be VP0, and B would be 1V1.

I do not think that there is a simple fix for this issue if my guess is correct.

The two options I see:
 # do not restrict the visibility of VP0 in this case
 ** this would imply that the agent could directly select VP0
 ** since VP0 and 1V1 are mapped to the same dropdown option in OSF -> the agent can only select VP0 together with 1V1, the replacement of 1V1 with VP0 then actually just removes 1V1 since VP0 is already selected.
 # maybe 1V1 should not be selectable in the first place
 ** instead of allowing the agent to select 1V1 which will automatically be replaced with VP0 allow the agent to select VP0 directly instead.

*Open questions:*

Which option is preferred by business?
 * if option 2 is preferred: should this also applied to other portals

What exactly are the affected cases? 
 * likely all test cases where the rule that replaces 1V1 with VP0 applies. 
 * Can business confirm that all cases affected by the rule below should be changed with either option 1 or 2?
 * The rule is: 

{code:java}
Rule 'Replace_1V1_with_VP0_when_ordering_KAI':
When
    selected products contain '1V1' and
    condition 'new_kip_order' applies and
    condition 'digitalSelected' applies
then
    deselect '1V1' and
    select 'VP0' with contract relation set to the main analog product. {code}
 ;;;","27/Sep/23 2:10 PM;nina.pickl@vodafone.com;As agreed yesterday, the issue will be discussed by the Ash team with Christian Lienbacher, regarding the expectations from a business perspective.;;;","27/Sep/23 6:46 PM;fabian.keilbach@vodafone.com;Analysis by Team Ash so far:
 * In case the scenario is reproduced as outlined in the ticket none of 1V1 or VP0 ever gets in the selection of the Cable Rules Plugin even when 1V1 is selected in the frontend
 * In case of ONLY booking TV (no KIP), we can select 1V1 in the frontend as expected and also see it in our Cable Rules Plugin logs 

We thus are lead to believe this is a problem of the frontend not putting the correct (or any) product in the selection in the defect case and therefore require a retest by techM in the following manner
 * Scenario to be reproduced shall be the flow described as steps to reproduce in the ticket
 * Cable logging enabled as in below image:

We did our analysis together with @Timo Hurai on OSE side and found the problematic checkout product 1V1 is not allowed after Processing of post cable rules. Below are the list of products which are allowed as part of cart after saving change provider details.
 
 {{=== THE FOLLOWING PRODUCTS SHOULD BE PRESENT IN CART AFTER CABLE POST CONDITION: CKH8, SN3, MFT, KH8, CD5, DH5, HDC:000, DV2:T02, TC2, DCX, SC, TOEVN, 9I0:B00, HO1:000, PC1:B01, AO0, FM4:B00, VSA, PAS, 01H:B06, OF5:B00, 69K, V3G, V3K, MTV, WTX21, 3K6, TECYESKIP, KIPOPENEDMARKER}}
First before post cable rules processing the product we added into cart please find below screenshot

!image-2023-10-05-13-08-57-210.png!

But after some seconds once the Post cable rules processing happened we removed the product becuase its not part of allowed list.
 
 {{=== REMOVED FROM CART PROD WITH SKU: 1V1 ===}}
Please find attached screenshot from DB after post processing of cable rules.

!image-2023-10-05-13-09-30-710.png!

For Cable packages we don’t compatibility rules on OSE side, addition / deletion of cable products from cart depend on Cable Pre/Post rules. Kindly assign back this with above information and also I am attaching the CableOmniusRules.log where we can find the details of on same.

[^CableOmniusRules.log];;;","05/Oct/23 6:06 PM;simon.auch@vodafone.com;Hi [~vikash.saurav@vodafone.com] ,
thank you for the investigation.
According to our investigation we do not have any Compatibility Rules that deselect 1V1, and as said before 1V1 also never appears in the input to the cable rules plugin. 
For completeness we attach the log of the cable rules plugin so you can check for yourself that 1V1 is never passed to the cable product logic as selected: [^cable_rules_artifact372637.log] 

When working with the log searching for ""1V1|true"" and ""1V1|false"" returns the corresponding input state of the product. You will find that no entry exist for ""1V1|true"".

As things stand there is nothing cable logic can do to deselect the product as the product is never select from the point of view of the cable product logic.

Please investigate on your side why 1V1 is never passed to CREP as selected once it is selected in the shopping cart (as seen in one of your screenshots).

Hi [~natasa.dimovic1@vodafone.com] 

As already mentioned you that this defect we have fixed on the rule level where the 1V1 was not sent as selected true. After fix this is sent as selected true to Cable artifact rule. Next Cable artifact process the input and send back final list which should be present in cart.

This can be verified by enabled Cable artifact rules on ACC and verify that 1V1 is sent on rules input for the package or not.

We can verify If we are sending 1V1 as true or false on artifact rule log file. If sending as true then plugin has to return the selected product back to OSE to keep that file in cart

The error message “Service PIN ist bei diesem Kunden nicht vorhanden” is displayed when Omnius gets the GET Call response from DXL with error code 404.

Hi [~natasa.dimovic1@vodafone.com] 

,As we verify the getcustomersearchresposne of both index search and legacy search we see,

Index search,,We receive 2 customer results one with cable and one with mobile, Hence you don’t see the SPIN message

as it is applicable for cable only

Now when you did legacy search, the response had only cable and there was no mobile customer returned

hence it is cable only ,SPIN is applicable here and we show the message.

Hi Natasa,

When we search a cable customer ,the getCustomerResponse has below result which is indicating that it's linked customer but has only cable details from OGW, You see *NO* other stack data, Hence OSF considers this as a cable customer and sends a get request for indices to DXL (as service PIN is applicable)

but we get no indices from DXL ,so we have to fallback to standard authentication with an error message.

Hi Natasa,
 
 
 Cable customer details are what we are getting the single result from the response for GetCustomerInfo (even for linked customers the Authentication method will work for each of the stack that are associated.

in this case spin will not be applicable for index but for legacy as we receive only cable ,ose considers it as cable customer.

maybe we need to set up a call again.

this is what i can see from the requests:
1. in index search we are searching with link id, so OGW return mobile and cable customer.

2. in legacy search we are searching only the cable customer so we are returning only cable customer data.

is something else is expected?

[~devi.jampana@vodafone.com] 

 Not a valid defect toward Omnius.

CR716 ILS is not in scope. suggest to invistegate with VF Cable team for cable rulez plugin.
Note : *Technician needed* OR *SelfInstallation* dropdown options visiblity and respective product in SC logic is exisitng and controlled via cable rulez plugin.

In CR716
(ABK = Yes or No) and *YES* has only scope if there is *Technician needed* dropdown option possible then make this option preset in readonly AND also not add chargeable product in SC.

other than, everything is existing behaviour.;;;","22/Sep/23 7:13 PM;nina.pickl@vodafone.com;[~devi.jampana@vodafone.com]

We have a mutually-exclusive category X ( here: access hardware)

 

If any of this Product A of X is chosen than a Product P (here: Product 10004 Shipping_Fee) should be Defaulted.

Only Exception: if Product B of X (here: Eigenhardware) is choosen, than Product P should not be added

 

We build a rule (here: CR006048)

If not B than defaulted-obligated P (Prio 6)
 
First Result:

If we switch from A to B P stay in the cart

 

I added an additional Prio 1 rule: If P is in the cart -> Do not allow P.

 

Result:

If we switch from A to B P is removed, which is fine.

But if I switch back from B to A I get the error

First of all we have found a workaround to make this particular business rule working.

However we still have the issue with a defaulted Product P and the check !cart.contains(P)

 

The example here is:

We have a (initial) default rule. If agent selects tariff A default hardware P. Of course this rule is true also in further runs of compRules

Agent switches manually to other hardware Q of this mutually exclusive category

If we have two distinguish rules:
 # cart.containsProduct(P) -> default product X 
 # !cart.containsProduct(P) -> Not ALLOW X 

We get this kind of error message: X cannot be added 

 

Regardless if the first or the second rule gets a higher prio we always run into trouble that either the product is added (but should not) or we get the above error message.

Please explain how to build the rules to make it working the whole time;;;","06/Nov/23 4:14 PM;saiswarup.singhdeo@vodafone.com;[~vikash.saurav@vodafone.com]  Any update on this defect ?;;;","06/Nov/23 5:24 PM;vikash.saurav@vodafone.com;hi [~marco.abraham01@vodafone.com]  can you please share non-working PCAT to reproduce this issue because earlier pcat file which you shared is failing while import.

To have a workaround in place, Marco did some changes on his side, but this is not permanent solution! its just a workaround until TechM has fixed the behavior with permanent fix.
So we should stop discussing that it might be solved already - YES IT IS WORKING -  but with workaround.

TechM has to give a fix for it, so Marco can remove his workaround.

Can you please look into the below comment

 

Regards

Srujana;;;","20/Sep/23 4:07 PM;simon.auch@vodafone.com;This can be changed on cable side, but I am relatively sure that this was never implemented for Unity.

Without CR-716 the agent could select both ""Anschluss ist bereits sehbereit"" or ""Anschluss ist nicht sehbereit"" but only ""Anschluss ist bereits sehbereit"" would actually do anything (selecting a marker product).

With CR-716 only the option with a valid product selection is left, but functionally everything behaves just like before.
The agent basically just had the illusion of a choice before.

If this behaviour should be changed I think it needs to be clarified if there are other cases for unity in which (at a self install address) the option ""Anschluss ist nicht sehbereit"" should be selectable. The other ES* products come to mind for example.;;;","22/Sep/23 4:50 PM;nina.pickl@vodafone.com;In clarification:

the technician option should be shown if KIP only is booked or is there an exception when booking ES5? If yes, then I would say the wrong option is displayed.

as I understood it, the technician section should never be shown for a KIP-only booking.

In the excel sheet, there are only 2 cases left in which we want to show the section in OSF, which are both TV-only cases.
!image-2025-02-03-08-44-34-740.png|width=1339,height=527!

For this use case, described in the description, the technician option is still displayed in the Access Details.

We are not sure if everything has already been implemented.

If everything has already been implemented then I would suggest to reject this bug. A new bug should be created then. Could you please check if there is maybe a bug on Cable side? Thank you;;;","03/Feb/25 1:33 PM;tobias.pohlmann@vodafone.com;Ah, okay, now I get it.

The target 20090213 is defined as DEFAULT, not DEFAULT OBLIGATED.
But even though, the product 20090213 cannot be deselected.
The software team must fix this issue, so the target product 20090213 is going to be put into shopping cart as default, but could be deselected anytime by agent if necessary.

*To reproduce this error:
===============*
Software version: any

Test stub: see attached file [^FN_ILS_FTTH_DTAG.zip] 
Log file: see attached file [^rules_debug_step3_selectHardware7590.log]

Step on OSF GUI 
============
1. search customer, any string
2. click on ""Paket Ändern"" change package
3. select a DTAG tarif
4. select any hardware which is not Fritzbox 5590

You would get below window, and the product 20090213 is not deselectable:

Hi [~shuyan.luo@vodafone.com]  ,

Based on the code investigation, it appears that this is not a issue, the manual_override_allowed field value is 0 in the catalog_package_subtypes table which is why its not allowing to deselect the hardware.

When the PCAT files are imported, the values of this field are set according to the values available in the PCAT files, so if the PCAT file does not contain this filed value for any stack, the value is considered to be 0.

When the manual_override_allowed field is set to 1 for a fixed stack, then the hardware can be deselected in the configurator according to the value in the manual_override_allowed field.

!image-2023-11-10-12-33-31-352.png!;;;","10/Nov/23 4:45 PM;shuyan.luo@vodafone.com;The attribute manual_override_allowed delete too much, so it couldn't be used as workaroud to fix our issue.

We identified the root cause of this issue and suggested to have mutual override allow enabled for sub package having these hardwares. but this was causing some other issues which i discussed with Marco and Shuyan.

I am trying with existing expression to fix this issue if not then next step would be to have a new expression which will override the logix written for mutual exclusive categories.

can you provide on which information it depends whether or not OSF displays the access details for TV and for KIP?
If this depends on certain product states it would be valuable to know for example which products, which property of this product etc.
If this depends on certain address properties it would be important to know on which address properties like tags, flags, etc.

It would be perfect if you could provide this information for both software versions on the ACC1 (v9.16.6-BB1) and the ACC2 (v9.17.0-BB46).

thank you for providing the examples, but I was hoping for the actual decisions OSF makes in order to determine whether or not to show the access details during the checkout.
Examples are in this case not sufficient to correctly determine the severity of the problem. 
After knowing the decisions OSF makes I would for example want to be able to now if OSF shows the access details if the cable product logic returns TECNOTV, TECYESTV, 1V1 as not visible, and VP0 as visible.

According to the answer from [~vikash.saurav@vodafone.com]  https://jira.sp.vodafone.com/browse/OS-42115?focusedId=2910953&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels:comment-tabpanel#comment-2910953 the display of the tv access details depends on the availability of the products TECNOTV and TECYESTV reported by the cable logic.

*Why does the workaround work?*

My *assumption* is that OSF remembers the availability of TECNOTV and/or TECYESTV from a previous execution of the cable logic.

If KIP is selected first, then the first executions of the cable product logic will return TECNOTV and TECYESTV as not available. 

If TV is selected first, then the first executions of the cable product logic will return either TECNOTV and/or TECYESTV as available.

-> This is something that has to be fixed by OSF

{*}What is the implication of the Workaround?{*}{*}{{*}}

Assuming cable product logic would return TECNOTV or TECYESTV as bookable the issue might persist in OSF, since as long as KIP is selected first TECNOTV and TECYESTV will still not be available from the start.

*Open questions from my perspective:*
 * which products exactly control the display of the tv access details in OSF?
 ** Is it only TECYESTV and TECNOTV or also products like VP0, 1V1?
 ** Is this controlled by special tags on products or categories, or are the products hardcoded in OSF?
Maybe [~vikash.saurav@vodafone.com] can answer this question?
 *  in which scenarios should which technician option be bookable in OSF?

 * 
 ** we have a list of ~80 test cases. Some of these are apparently not correct.
 ** Who can go through these test cases with us and determine which of them need to be changed?
 ** Without at least a contact person that can answer this question it will not make sense to start implementation of this ticket.

Following is the answer to the query to show Access details or New connection section for KIP and Kable TV.

For the section to be visible, the cable artifact result must contain at least one product matching the option types.

technician_needed_no 
technician_needed_yes

If there is no result for those options, the section will not be displayed.

Hello [~simon.auch@vodafone.com] , Please find the details below.

It is hard to give an exact timing for this feature since it seems to have been implemented a long time ago. I recommend contact with Vodafone BA for more information.
Unity Media works exactly the same as normal Kable TV and KIP products to display the access details section.

so, PORPDT-345 will not make this requirement obsolete, it will just slightly shift how it looks.

The new requirements are: if only TV is ordered, show the section. If TV + Internet is ordered, don't show it.

The new problem is this:
If the agent books the packages in the following order
 * TV
 * KIP

then the TV accessibility section is shown, but it should not.

The problem is still the same as described by [~simon.auch@vodafone.com] in the comment from 21/Sep/2023: 
OSF seems only to decide on whether to show the accessibility section for TV when the TV package is opened. So,
 * we first open TV and book a TV Connect ---> OSF sees that 1V1 and TECNOTV are available and correctly assumes that it should show the TV accessibility section
 * we then open the internet section and book some GigaZuhause tariff ---> from now on, 1V1 and TECNOTV are not available anymore, but OSF seems to not update its opinion on the TV accessibility and will display it anyway
 * IF the user just simply opens the TV package again (without changing anything), OSF updates again and will correctly NOT display it

This is something we cannot fix and still need a change from OSF.;;;","13/Jun/24 3:31 PM;ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com;[~tobias.pohlmann@vodafone.com]  I am not able to get your comment

Thank you for the re-test.

The failure in case 2, where the technician option for KIP is wrongly displayed, is again the OSF bug discussed further below:
- when you book KIP first, then OSF calculates the technician option it wants to show for KIP, which is for a pure KIP order on an self-install address currently ""Anschluss ist sehbereit"".

- when you then book TV, it will not update the technician option it wants to show for KIP, and just show it regardless.

- when you just simply open the KIP package after the TV selection again, OSF _will_ update its opinion and not show the KIP technician section.

We cannot do anything here on our side and would need a fix from TechM side, so that OSF will always update both the TV and KIP technician section, no matter which package is currently opened.

 

About the ""Verbindungsdaten speichern"" field I don't know much unfortunately --neither how it is controlled nor what the desired logic behind it is.;;;","01/Jul/24 7:53 PM;ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com;[~tobias.pohlmann@vodafone.com]  we see a mismatch in behavior in case we book Broadvision KIP or different KIP 

For broadvision KIP its working as described by Timo Russo


Book BV KIP first, then TV -> section for technician is not displayed ->  {color:#00875a}*OK*{color}
Book other KIP first, then TV -> section for technician is displayed -> {color:#de350b}*NOT OK*{color}

{color:#de350b}*Can you confirm that for other KIP then BV also section for technician should be removed?*

{color:#172b4d}Its not about booking TV first, and then KIP. We handle this use case separately, we are aware that there might be an issue.
*But for now we only want to understand the behavior for  [[PORPDT-345]|https://de.jira.agile.vodafone.com/browse/PORPDT-345]*{color};;;","02/Jul/24 3:06 PM;tobias.pohlmann@vodafone.com;Hi, Ariadne,

{*}{color:#de350b}yes, I can confirm that in any case where we book KIP + TV (no matter if Broadvision or not, no matter which order we book it in), no technician section should be shown{color}{*}. 

The reason why this fails is as I tried to point out in my comment below. It really is pretty confusing, I apologize for that. I had a call with Natasa where I explained the problem, because it really is a bit hard to grasp.

So again in case of Broadvision what happens is:
 - [In the KIP package] KIP is booked, TV Connect is added because of Broadvision ---> OSF understands that no section for KIP should be shown because KIP + TV is booked and remembers that

 - [In the TV package] TV Digital is booked ---> OSF understands that no section for TV should be shown because KIP+TV is booked

==> no KIP or TV technician section is shown

In case of Not-Broadvision:
 - [In the KIP package] Only KIP is booked, but not TV yet ----> OSF supposes that a technician section should be shown for KIP (because only KIP is booked) and remembers that
 - [In the TV package] TV Digital + TV Connect is booked ----> OSF understands that no section for TV should be shown because KIP+TV is booked, but doesn't update the reasoning for KIP

==> technician section is shown for KIP, but not for TV;;;","09/Jul/24 5:42 PM;natasa.dimovic1@vodafone.com; ** There was a change on PCAT side: [[PORPDT-345] BV - Removal of Ready-to-Watch (Sehbereitschaft) Section - DE Jira (vodafone.com)|https://de.jira.agile.vodafone.com/browse/PORPDT-345]

*Open questions from my perspective:*
 * which products exactly control the display of the tv access details in OSF?
 ** Is it only TECYESTV and TECNOTV or also products like VP0, 1V1?
 ** Is this controlled by special tags on products or categories, or are the products hardcoded in OSF?
Maybe [~vikash.saurav@vodafone.com] can answer this question?
 * If the display of the checkout part is only controlled by TECYESTV and TECNOTV, this will not work (and from cable side never should have) for Unity, since these two products are not aligned and should never be available for Unity.
Which TV technician option should be bookable in Unity TV scenarios? As far as I am aware there is no TV technician product that is available in the Unity footprint.
 *  in which scenarios should which technician option be bookable in OSF?

 * 
 ** we have a list of ~80 test cases. Some of these are apparently not correct.

If we are following the below steps in ACC2 then we are able to see the Access details even now:

Steps:

1)select TV Product and KIP section 

2)select the TV Product

3)Donot select any product in KIP

4)Move forward it will throw an error that we have to select the KIP Product in check out section

5)Go back and select the KIP Product now

6)Move forward and fill customer details

7)Then we are able to see the access details for TV

Note:we tried this steps 3 to 4 times and we are able to see the access details once

[~devi.jampana@vodafone.com] for now I would ignore the case you had and focus on the scenario described in the ticket: a TV order without KIP.
I think my initial question is still unanswered:
When does OSF show the access details section for TV in a unity scenario?

If the answer to this question is ""when at least one product in the technician_needed_no or technician_needed_yes category is visible according to the cable product logic"" then the next question we need answered is why was the section shown in previous versions?

[~nina.pickl@vodafone.com] could you figure out a version where this worked last time?;;;","28/Sep/23 8:18 PM;simon.auch@vodafone.com;According to an answer from Vikash in another ticket [OS-42115] OSF | ACC2 | Wave 8.1 | CR716 Futurize regression defect | when booking KIP and TV the access details for TV are not displayed - Vodafone Global Jira
""It is hard to give an exact timing for this feature since it seems to have been implemented a long time ago. I recommend contact with Vodafone BA for more information.
Unity Media works exactly the same as normal Kable TV and KIP products to display the access details section."".
To me this is a direct conflict to the information that this ever worked in the (recent) past.
Without a specific version in which it worked before I have the feeling this discussing is not leading anywhere.

If we want to change this we need a requirement from Business regarding which tv technician options to align for unity or accept that the tv access details are not shown in unity cases.;;;","29/Sep/23 12:27 PM;nina.pickl@vodafone.com;Hi [~simon.auch@vodafone.com],

can you maybe help us here if there is an old requrement that for Unity TV orders the Access Details Section should be shown in Checkout?

We only found the following Bug, but need also the requrenment with wich it was officially requested earlier.

We tried placing broadvision products in ACC2

For that TV product we are able to see the Access details

Could you please check that

*Steps to reproduce:*

ACC2 Retail/Telesales:

Address:50931 KÖLN KRINGSWEG 1

select any KIP Product

click on weiter

TV product will be added automatically

check the access details for the TV product

 ;;;","17/Oct/23 3:05 PM;simon.auch@vodafone.com;Hi Devi,

I have no clue what OSF is doing here, but definitely not how it should behave to the best of my knowledge.
I could reproduce the issue and make the following two screenshots:
!image-2023-10-17-11-31-41-319.png!
!image-2023-10-17-11-32-04-497.png!

Which shows that OSF thinks that 1V1/VP0/TECYESTV/TECNOTV should be selected. That is not correct since the last execution of the cable product logic up to that point in the checkout process returns none of these 4 products as visible.
For completeness I attached the log of the session up to the dropdown in the checkout: [^cable_rules_artifact_OS42066.log]

Please find out when the access details are shown in the checkout. All information until now seems to conflict with the unity case. Maybe there is a special handling for unity addresses hardcoded in OSF?;;;","19/Oct/23 11:57 AM;ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com;Hi [~simon.auch@vodafone.com]  

regarding ""All information until now seems to conflict with the unity case"" -> for CR716 we have raised also defects for VKD and not only for Unity, so something is in general wrong in this access details section.

As the latest observation happened after having new broadvision product catalogue in place, should we raise a defect against CR756? Or against Product catalogue?
I do not want to mix this defect here with behavior shown for broadvision products, otherwise will be even more confusing;;;","19/Oct/23 1:20 PM;simon.auch@vodafone.com;Hi Ariadne,
maybe it was not clear what I meant with ""All information until now seems to conflict with the unity case"":
 * We have multiple answers (in this ticket and in other tickets) saying that TECNOTV and TECYESTV control the display of the section (and did so in the past)

 * 
 ** this can't be the case for unity as those are not aligned products
 * In other answers it was mentioned that it is controlled not by TECNOTV and TECYESTV but by categories containing TECNOTV, TECYESTV, 1V1, VP0
 ** sound better, but also all of these products are not aligned and should never have been orderable for unity

In the newly encountered behaviour by Devi (https://jira.sp.vodafone.com/browse/OS-42066?focusedId=2974883&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels:comment-tabpanel#comment-2974883) suddenly the access details are shown. Even though TECNOTV , TECYESTV, VP0, and 1V1 are not bookable according to cable product logic?

Someone has to look into the OSE source code and check _systematically_ when this section is shown. I expect there to be _something_ hardcoded for VFW, but I cannot check that myself.

Without an explanation from OSE side when this section is shown I don't know how else to help with this defect. If it is supposed to be based on the orderability of specific categories {_}then the new behaviour is a OSE contradicts it because no product from that category is orderable in the scenario clicked by me{_}. So for starters this could be analysed and maybe we get some insight which logic we are missing from OSE.  

I would not open another defect for this observation.;;;","23/Oct/23 5:21 PM;ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com;we have agreed that general analysis of CR716 defects regarding installation logic is required.

 This should happen with an valid german IBAN as well, but it is not clear why this was implemented like this and if there was a communication issue or not . If there was, we need clear specifications on how this should work exactly and the different cases so we can implement an appropriate fix.

Hi Harsha,
 
If the KUD product is not part of cable_app_de category then this check will not be shown and the agent is able to continue, otherwise this check will be shown and the agent will not be able to continue
 * In case of telesales, if sepa is true, then this check will be shown and the flow is blocked → agent is not able to continue

For further clarifications, you can check the original story :

https://jira.sp.vodafone.com/browse/OAF-179

OMNIUS : CHCK, As an agent i am allowed to proceed sales flow for cable package with mandatory residence check when SEPA is known, So that Agent can proceed next.;;;","26/Jul/23 10:53 AM;singireddy.reddy@vodafone.com;Will discuss with ari.;;;","15/Aug/23 8:40 PM;ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com;I still do not get it.

The story says: As an agent i am allowed to proceed sales flow for cable package with mandatory residence check when SEPA is known

-> In our example, SEPA Is known - but we are blocked and NOT able to proceed.
-> we are NOT using foreign IBAN

Something is wrong relate to the logic when we do not enter the IBAN itself but bank account and sort code !!
its only allowed for german bank data to use this option to enter bank account and sort code instead of IBAN

Hi Harsha/Ari,

This was clear from the beginning, yes, but as I mentioned, the implementation was intended to be like this :

*In case of telesales, if sepa is true, then this check will be shown and the flow is blocked → agent is not able to continue*

Which means that it does *NOT* matter _what IBAN is used_ , this will be shown if the sepa is true and *If the KUD product is part of cable_app_de category .* 

I agree that the way this is working is not consistent : in one case the agent is able to continue but in another the agent is not able to continue.

The final question is - when should the agent be able to continue the checkout process and when should the agent be blocked? According to the initial documentation the agent should not be able to continue and according to these comments the agent should be able to continue .

What is the purpose of this error message and what was wrongly implemented exactly? We can implement a fix according to these comments but we need to know if the issue is that the whole implementation was not done correctly or not, in order to fix the actual issue and not just a particular case .;;;","17/Aug/23 4:38 PM;ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com;The pop up says its not allowed to continue b{*}ecause of a foreign bank account or/ and different bank account holder{*}.

OAF-179 is NOT relevant here, it might be issue from omnius side.

I will reproduce the issue and attach ConvertandvalidateIBAN logs for 
1) putting the data in bank account and sort code field

2) putting the IBAN directly in IBAN field

Then TechM can compare. For now I reduced the priority as it is only happening for specific cases and can be avoided by using direct IBAN field. 
I will probably not make it before Thursday to attach relevant data, tomorrow is workhop in Campus;;;","05/Sep/23 6:34 PM;bharath.krishnamurthy@vodafone.com;[~ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com]

Hi Srujana ,

 

Firstly this is not error its feature. Check the below attached details which explains when and how the SEPA validation works. In the above case you can validate the same by getting *GetCablePayerAndPaymentInfo* details.

If you have any queries regarding this could you please schedule a call to conclude on expected behavior or please create new ticket for latest observation.;;;","08/Feb/24 1:37 PM;ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com;[~bharath.krishnamurthy@vodafone.com]  I am sorry but its not about a feature which should work in this way and we are running into circles all the time.

everything was properly explained and understood by Kshitik.

 

Please translate the error message into english! Its an error message that we are not allowed to go ahead because of foreign customer, or different bank account adress.

We are NOT using foreign adress or foreign IBAN here. We are also NOT using different bank account adress. 

We do not want to repeat the discussion again and again, please get in touch in Kshitij

 

You have to use the entry bank account number and sort code to enter it manually, then system is creating IBAN on its own automatically. 

If same IBAN would be typed in directly it works.

MOM Of yesterdays call:

We had a discussion with Sunil, Bharath and Kshitij

We tried to place the orders in both the ways

i.e with Filling the IBAN directly and also by giving the account number and sort code details 

And we received the same error in both the ways and we checked the response in logs (ValidateIBAN and GetPayerandPaymentInfo ) and observed that customer details are not retrieved in the response as the IBAN provided are invalid IBANS

 

But We have also tried with the Correct German IBANS(Below are the IBANS Used) and still we received the same error (I.e IBAN is not german)

DE10600501010006622066

DE02120300000000202051

DE21200505500001183151,  DE69200505500001083153 (These 2 IBANS has always  worked with KUD Orders previously)

For these 4 IBANS we have checked the Logs (VlaidateIBAN and GetPayerandPaymentInfo ) and we recieved the correct response( i.e Customer details are visible on the Response and also SEPA is showing as true )

Hi [~devi.jampana@vodafone.com]

We have analyzed further and found that there is recent requirement over (https://jira.sp.vodafone.com/browse/OAF-690) [!https://bmcomviva.atlassian.net/images/icons/issuetypes/epic.svg!VFDED1FTS-5531: CR780 - Change of payment validation check for existing SEPA mandatIN DESIGN|https://bmcomviva.atlassian.net/browse/VFDED1FTS-5531] which is now available as part of the software where we are testing the above scenario.

As part the requirement we are now showing NOTIFICATION MODAL and disable ""Weiter"" button of payment section if the scenario we are performing meets below conditions.

System will validate if payment method = ""direct debit""

For the blank data or no PayerAndPaymentInfo response issue +OS-52308+ /VFDEW82E2E-94 is handle via improvement ticket. ref +OAF-744+ VFDED1FTS-5844

 

this the ticket description and comment says issue (open issue is with when agent capture bank details (Bank account number 1241111    Sort Code 70050000)) was fixed with new version of code

Please schedule a meeting to discuss with ACC team. this looks to me 2 issues are mix in one ticket;;;","23/Apr/24 7:29 PM;ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com;[~bharath.krishnamurthy@vodafone.com]  the ticket OS-37304 was raised long time before OS-52308 but as long as OS-52308 is not closed we cannot check further on OS-37304

For this specific scenario still the flow is blocked. its not fixed by CR780/OAF-744 which was deployed today to ACC1

Steps to reproduce

1) Start new order entry for new customer, enter any GERMAN adress
2) Select KUD product from list e.g. Giga TV home Net 
3) proceed to checkout, residence information is displayed (OK)

4) Fill Checkout sections until IBAN section

+*IMPORTANT TO FOLLOW NOW EXACT STEPS*+

5) Click on credit card SYMBOL and enter Sort Code from a German bank institute e.g. 70050000 and any bank account number 

!image-2024-05-16-14-16-28-620.png|width=766,height=490!

6) click on ""Ermitteln"" -> automatically the system creates a valid GERMAN IBAN {color:#de350b}*(IT IS NOT A FOREIGN IBAN)*{color}

!image-2024-05-16-14-17-37-757.png|width=912,height=701!

7) Select Invoice adress and try to proceed -> Error is shown that there is foreign IBAN (WRONG, its GERMAN IBAN) or different invoice adress (WRONG, its not different)

!image-2024-05-16-14-19-58-501.png|width=1008,height=758!

The IBAN is a correct GERMAN IBAN - its just not typed in into the IBAN field but created automatically by the system when entering bank account number and sort code !!

ali;;;","15/Dec/22 8:01 PM;heike.eisenlohr1@vodafone.com;I think this bug was created when we did not receive any status updates due to some misconfiguration in the weborder DB. We fixed that configuration issue on Nov 8 (WeborderDBRelease 2190.2022.11.00.03). 
Since then it should work, also for manually approved orders since the weborder ID should be sufficient to get an order status.
Does the error still occur? If yes, do you have example orders? ;;;","16/Dec/22 2:06 PM;ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com;as per latest Discussion with Daniel, the customer ID is relevant to get the status. But for manual approved orders the customer id is not available in a short time. But if helpful we can create another order.... it would be great if issue is solved, because it is there since months.
At the same time we received order status completed for all orders which got auto approved.

 

[~singireddy.reddy@vodafone.com]  can you please create a new customer order on ACC1 for unitymedia which would force manual approval? You can place an order on an adress where the same IBAN is already used, and same customer name. Then it will come to manual approval.

Created 2 orders that went into manual.
We got them approved, one as a new customer order, one as an existing customer order. (this doesn't change the status, it remains open)
We got them closed (this changes the status)
The status closed was picked up by the UOTracker and is also visible from OSF (This means that we didn't find a bug)

Our current best guess from looking at the screenshots is that: in that case the order was only approved and not closed and as such the order status didn't change, so there was nothing to show in OSF.;;;","11/May/23 4:47 PM;ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com;[~singireddy.reddy@vodafone.com]  can you please run one test case again on ACC1 with manual approval?

Step 1: Once the order is transferred to the backend, order should be in progress in ordermanager

Step 1: Complete the order (execute as new customer order) and check if it gets completed in frontend order manager

Please check as well if the customer id is transferred back to OSF

Very long time ago I already mentioned that I assume we are not getting back the real customer ID and therefore we do not get the status completed

1) in case the order is auto approved, we immediately get back the customer ID from unity backend, and it works fine

2) in case the order is manual approved after some time, somehow a second ""update"" is missing, which would return the customer ID 

But through all the discussions it was stated it should not be a problem in this area. I still feel that this gap is somewhere in this process.

so after the meeting today we agree that we need to check with Cable why OGW is not getting customer id in any of the set order status.
this is the reason why oneDMS call is failing.;;;","27/Nov/23 4:28 PM;ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com;The discussion in the beginning of this defect and my understanding all the time:

In case order is auto approved, customer ID is immediately given back to VKD Gateway
In Case order is NOT auto approved but later manually, there is no new call to get the customer ID -> thats why its not available

But in between it was mentioned that this is not the issue - as its working for retail, its strange that not working for Telesales.

Please note that OneDMS is handling Telesales Unity like VKD for Contract Summary Archiving. Not sure if relevant.

We got the information that for Auto approval orders we can see the customer number and Unified Order ID ,so success status is reflecting in OSF

But for Manual approval orders, Customer id is not available in logs and also Unified Order ID is missing and Action is getting skipped

Hi All,
Thank you all for joining the call!!
 
Please find the final Action points below from our call today:
 
	1. [~nina.pickl@vodafone.com] and [~rohan.kumbhar@vodafone.com] have discussed with [~simon.auch@vodafone.com] regarding this defect.
	
Action Point:

	1. [~nina.pickl@vodafone.com] will check with [~ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com] and update the defect. If required then CR will be raised.


;;;","07/Dec/23 1:51 PM;nina.pickl@vodafone.com;Updates:

 

OGW needs the customer number in case Unity Manual Approval Orders in Telesales and Retails, which should be provided from VKD to OGW within the existing FulfillmentStarted Request.

 

The customer number is atm provided only for Auto Approval Orders, but missing for Manual Approval orders, therefore the document cannot be archived and the OGW processing remain in status pending (the VKD status is SUCCESS but the orders don't get Sucecss status in OSF Fronend):

An error was encountered while invoking ScanView-SaveDocument WS. Details [Error_Code: HTTPOutbound_0001, Error_Message: Received a fault from processing server for service '/ScanView-001/SaveDocument': An invalid number format or number value was encountered.

Note: Retail Manual Approval Orders don't have this issue because the call to oneDMS/Customernumber is not needed for the E2E flow. They get the Status Success.

 

As the customer number has not been sent for Manual Approval Order until now, a new PST change is required.

I will take the topic with me and check if we can request this change at the PST CAT train, Team Ash(Benjamin Sachse) or Nora.

 

The new requirement should contain following information:
 * no difference between retail and telesales from cable perspective
 * example set status messages received by OSF
 * fulfilment started from manual approval 
 * fulfilment started from automatic approval 


 * explanation on
 * what you clicked to create the manual approval order
 * how to approve the manual approval order

Will update here once it is clear how to process with the new change.;;;","18/Dec/23 3:04 PM;nina.pickl@vodafone.com;In Progress by PST Ash Team, corresponding Jira Ticket in PST Jira:

[~simon.auch@vodafone.com] 

Elango performed the same flow on the both environments ACC1/test2b and ACC2/test3b- on ACC2/test3b worked fine, but not on ACC1/test2b.

Can you please check if the fix is available on test2b or what can be the reason otherwise?

 ;;;","01/Feb/24 4:26 PM;simon.auch@vodafone.com;So, the obvious difference between test3b (working) and test2b (not working) is that on test3b the status update is a `COMPLETED_SUCCESS` while on the test2b it is a `IN_PROGRESS_FULFILLMENT_STARTED`.

It can be seen that the unity order tracker on the test2b does not trigger any more updates for the order after the one with the status OPEN (for which we already have a customer ID as seen in the log).

I checked the test2b database contains the UME_ORDER_STATUS 'COMPLETED', which is correct, but apparently not written by the unity order tracker. Maybe there is a race condition between the unity order tracker and some other service that tries to write this field? This would also explain why it only happens sometimes.;;;","01/Feb/24 4:47 PM;nina.pickl@vodafone.com;[~elango.durairaj@vodafone.com]  Can you please check if the test2b order was successfully approved AND closed in Unity Backend?

 

Thanks [~simon.auch@vodafone.com] 

Was it not agreed/ implemented, that the customer number should be transferred in fullfilment started status?
h2. Desired Situation:

That's why a change is needed that the customer number is transferred to OGW in the *fulfilment started status* message from VKD.;;;","01/Feb/24 5:19 PM;elango.durairaj@vodafone.com;[~nina.pickl@vodafone.com]  785791 ACC1 , test2b,  order was successfully completed in unity backend without any issue.

My assumption right now is, that the ""lost"" updates before where due to the environment issues on VFW side and we actually only have the issue of updates that are send by another VKD system that are not supposed to be sent for VFW orders.;;;","27/Mar/24 4:08 PM;ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com;[~simon.auch@vodafone.com]  I am not really sure if I understand your comment correctly.

So you mean that we have to retry it once again because backend might had some problems?

The ""lost"" updates most likely were due to the environment issues on VFW side, or at least we cannot reproduce them anymore since they have been fixed.
The problematic updates sent to OSF by other cable systems that are missing the customer ID, should not happen anymore.

For some reason the unity system did not create an ""order"" (compared to the ""pending order"") in this case. This however seems to be a general problem on the UAT06 right now. I asked Mirko Saviano for some input regarding this.

""As I learned now, that someone currently stopped the approval job in Cablemaster. Perhaps that is the reason""

As 7.2 testing itself is not started it is not correct to raise a defect on 7.2.so we are marked it as resolved.Please reopen it when if needed after you tested in 7.2 build. ;;;","16/Nov/22 1:57 PM;ariadne.thun1@vodafone.com;Hi [~bhagyashri.sorate@vodafone.com]  it is regular process to move defects from one wave to the next wave in case they are not ready in time. Also, if we identify new issues which are not critical and do not need to be fixed in a production fix delivery (as this is too risky also) they have to be fixed with the next possible release.

Not sure why you want to reject all tickets for Wave 7.2

They are raised to make sure you include the fix in the initial delivery for Wave 7.2 already 

If you confirm this is fixed with initial Wave 7.2 delivery we are going to retest after this delivery is in place in December and then we close it
