Since we don’t get CallBack from OM on SIT2, document will not get generated at front-end, we need to trigger senddocumentcallback manually.

Due to some OM limitations we get CallBack from OM on SIT1 only.

The problem was that the attribute options for attribute package_type where removed/missing.

Still we are not sure why this has happened.
{{select * from eav_attribute_option_value where option_id in ( SELECT option_id FROM eav_attribute_option where attribute_id = 132);}}
The values are coming from upgrade script not from pcat files, it is not clear how the values have been altered. However these tables are part of the pcatexport so we just restored the st9 pcat to the environments that have a problem. This way the correct attribute options are available and after running the import process again we see the issue is no longer observed.

They must be a Component Type as {*}Insurance{*}. And this is OGW existing functionality where Component Type Insurance is one of the pre-condition for Marsh file to be created.

As the new handset insurance special SOCs CO3SD1080, CO3SD1100, CO3SD1120 and CO3SD1140 are not setup in KIAS as contract SOCs, the SQL-script in PAPS needs to be enhanced accordingly to add the component type 'HIS' also for SKUs being part of the new category 'Mobile->VODAFONE_COVER_PLUS'.;;;","11/Apr/23 4:59 PM;thomas.wermke@vodafone.com;The PCAT export below now contains the fix:

According to user story the above component field will be applicable based on certain criteria.

on that one criteria is it should be *sim only tariff + insurance product.* so its working fine according to that scenario in sit3

 

*Cart contains sim-only tariff together with new option insurance product*

I was trying to run ILS flow in retail channel of SIT3 but could not see below Insurance products available on configurator to select.

Our assumption is there might be some issue with 8.0 build which Omnius deployed yesterday on SIT3.

Because till yesterday is was working fine as we had Omnius build 7.2, after Omnius deployed 8.0 it’s not working.

Everything seems to be fine from product catalog side, please find SS below from SIT1 and SIT3.

Sales service rules conflict in rules between DTAG and GPON for Fibre products

It is satisfying with 2 rules, hence Access technology is getting added 2 times for he package type DSL

Talked with Bharath. The first issue ""Achtung

On 23.03.2023 New error is thrown because of DSL technology can not be determined. New Error message ""Achtung

See also ""OREF-272 Umbau in PAPS auf technologieabhängige Bandbreiten"" and ""OREF-355 OSF | ACC1 | Wave 7.1 | Access Technology not visible in Shopping cart"". So this error is only happend specially on test environment, not on production.

 ;;;","28/Mar/23 4:17 PM;shuyan.luo@vodafone.com;28.03.2023 run the testcase with Bharath together on the SIT envirnoment.
And it was running fine with the address Am Seestern 430 40547 Düsseldorf .

Issue happens only if tester is using his own Mocks, with below fake data:
 !screenshot-1.png|thumbnail! 
And this issue happens because we don't have any Bandwidth 250 definition for IP Bitsteam, see also ""CRFN200 ILS: Technology IP-Bitstream obligated"" . So some years ago, as IP Bitsream goes life, the maximum bandwidth of it was 100 Mbits, till now we didn't get any change request to enhance it with higher bandwidth.

So the issue mentioned on this ticket is actually not an error. In case you want to enhance the IP-Bitstream with bandwith 250 Mbits, Let's talk to Business OnDemand Team at first.

Hi Froehlich,

 

I don’t see an issue in EAI side. EAI is receiving an error from KIAS stating that “BAN don't exist, Backend Error Code: 2”. EAI is converting the backend error code into EAI error code “EAI000056” and sending it back with Functional fault. 

It is a test data issue.

 

Need KIAS team mail distro to send a mail for further updates.

And need to assign this defect to KIAS team.

 

PF the below details and attached logs.

 

*Customer Data:*

90562750,  KS_90562750

29998667,  KS_29998667

As we all know that since last week 21{^}st{^} Feb 2023 – until 28{^}th{^} Feb 2023—we had a Critical issue which blocked both SIT/ACC env –where we were facing OILàOGW timeouts due to which everything in testing was blocked.

 

Finally, after a lot of  investigations, analysis and checks –we identified the Root cause of the issue, which now has been fixed and now we aren’t getting any timeout issue on the envs.

 

Just to summarize – please do find the below RCA of the issue:-

 

{*}+Issue+{*}:- Timeout problems while connecting OILàOGW

 

*+Impact+* : All SIT/ACC Testing Env execution were blocked—Impacted SIT deliveries, Regression testing delay, Production build release delays

 

{*}+Issue occurrence reason+{*}: There was an upgrade done on the Kafka Linux servers on 20{^}th{^} Feb 2023(10PM CET) –where during upgrade all the 3 Broker nodes were also by default updated. Post upgrade by unknown reason #1 nodes Java Jdk version was upgraded to higher version than the other 2 nodes.—due to which when request was triggered to this #1 node—SSL handshake issues were encountered.

 

*+Resolution for fix:-+* #1 nodes Java JDK version was downgraded and broker node restarted.

 ;;;","06/Mar/23 9:34 AM;bhuvi.chowdhary@vodafone.com;one small correction:

 

where during upgrade all the 3 Broker nodes were also by default updated

Only 1 broker was patched not all – which causes inaccessibility of this broker.

The other 2 are NOT patched or updated.

Usually, errors of this kind are caused by OGW which is not working, unavailable, or working too slowly.

But to make sure, [@Irina Beshenko (Euvic)|mailto:irina.beshenko@euvic.pl] is just logging to the SIT servers and checking.;;;","21/Feb/23 6:50 PM;bharath.krishnamurthy@vodafone.com;[~bhavika.kohale@vodafone.com]

Hi Bhavika
In short: different data on the same machine processes in different way.

It seems like OGW can not deal with such kind of  data inside and timeout occur.

 I`ve started two ProcessOrderRequests:

first - new with ACQ

second - ILSBLU

Data inside request differs

The second one processed without any TimeOuts. The First  - TimeOut occured.

We successfully generated Send Request to OGW

Switched on NLog : FileLogger

In some cases I faced with one more error in this request. Sometimes it responds (I didn`t change the request)

Hi Piyush,

The issue needs to be analysed on OGW side. Apparently, depending on the data, the service works different way.

As I can see from logs, OGW has not received OMSendDocumentCallback request from SBUS yet.

RCA of this defect:

There were some dependencies  not running as expected so the ROM was not working normal, so we restarted these dependencies and then restarted the OM instances so it is working fine. ;;;","13/Mar/23 3:37 PM;bharath.krishnamurthy@vodafone.com;[~bhuvi.chowdhary@vodafone.com]

As per SBUS log the document is created and received in SBUS side as you see following, so maybe required to restart OGW servers also make sure OGW connect to SBUS via HTTPs not HTTP, so please ask OGW team to restart OGW server.

I checked and compared with branch 7.2 where I found that for branch Wave8.0 most of the Stop/setup/start files are missing that’s reason deployment is getting failed. Therefore, build doesn’t contain those files and failed when script is looking for that files.

[@Joshua Grady-Share|mailto:JoshuaG@Amdocs.com]: Here, I think branch creation or branch merge for Wave8.0 was not done properly. Can we create the branch 8.0 again for o2a ? Kindly check and suggest.

Hi Pallavi

 

As per the response logs attached there are no shops available due to which you are seeing the error message in the UI.

This is expected behavior as there are no pickup locations at that address.

So please use different address where OGW/SAP sends the pickup locations in the getpickuplocation service then you will be able to see the shops in UI and able to select them.;;;",10/Feb/23 12:58 PM;pallavi.chaudhari1@vodafone.com;{*}We required test data(different address{*}) to test this functionality .Vodafone team is checking -  for the same and correct address where we can able to see the DHL store list ;;;,13/Feb/23 1:19 PM;pallavi.chaudhari1@vodafone.com;We are waiting for - to received the response from Vodafone team to provide the  test data(different address) for DHL;;;,15/Feb/23 10:52 AM;ajay.yashwantbhavar@vodafone.com;[~pallavi.chaudhari1@vodafone.com] [~piyush.thakre@vodafone.com] Can you try with 46147 as zipCode.;;;,15/Feb/23 11:39 AM;pallavi.chaudhari1@vodafone.com;Currently we are facing some deployment issue on SIT1 once It will resolved will give a try with 46147 zipcode .;;;,16/Feb/23 10:59 AM;pallavi.chaudhari1@vodafone.com;Due to OS-32058 we cant able to test with given zipcode ;;;,20/Feb/23 2:53 PM;pallavi.chaudhari1@vodafone.com;We have tried with the zip code 46147 as provided by Vodafone team but still not able to see the DHL stores for pickup selection;;;,21/Feb/23 9:48 AM;pallavi.chaudhari1@vodafone.com;We have tried with zip code 44143 as provided by VF team but still not able to see the DHL store so we have requested for complete address ;;;,"27/Feb/23 10:08 AM;bhuvi.chowdhary@vodafone.com;Hi Nithi/Galal,

I had a call with Ahmed, and we corrected the file. There is a logic on EAI for picking the file and sending it in response. Based on soap header input value of boid, EAI simulator picks the file and process the response. So, the file name should be in sync with boid otherwise you will get a default response.

Hi Pallavi

 

As per the attached logs we can clearly see the below error message received from OGW due to which you are not able to see any pick up location.

Please check with OGW team on this

Have investigated the issue and found that same product with different pcat on same build gives different results. From my understanding *shippingfee* related product looks to be pcat issue. thats why we are not receiving *packageSubType* node value

From my understanding and reviewing code it looks like pcat issue.. Also based on timo comment we might need to get raw pcat files as well to confirm whether pcat issue only. can we get raw pcat files to proceed further

Hi Pallavi,

Requested in mail for Raw PCAT files , once we get that files then we can check it again and confirm it as PCAT issue.

Now as per dev analysis it is not a code issue from Omnius side, looks like PCAT issue only.

For further confirmation and clarification we requested raw PCAT files on SIT1 ENV;;;","31/Jan/23 12:50 PM;bharath.krishnamurthy@vodafone.com;[~pallavi.chaudhari1@vodafone.com] , [~gaurav.chauhan4@vodafone.com]

hi [~pallavi.chaudhari1@vodafone.com] we verified the logs and see that ,in the getIdentmethod response we only receive online, door and store

hence only these 3 identmethods are shown.

If you are expecting DHLident then same should be received in getidentmethod response.
